# biomed_genai

Generative AI data curation and model patterns that take advantage of publicly available BioMedical articles.

This collection of research articles, it's curation, and developement of data assets are in support of building data assets generative AI applications.

The Data Assets to be created in this project are:
 - Vector Index using Databricks Vector Search 
 - Instruction Fine-Tuning Dataset
 - Synthetic Training Data

The data curation and generative AI application tasks are:
 - Article File Management 
 - Parse and curation
 - Chunk and format content
 - Create Index on Content
 - Instruction Fine-Tune a model
 - Pre-train a model
 - Create a base chat model endpoint
 - Create a RAG chat model endpoint
 - Create a Pre-trained RAG chat model endpoint
 - Evaluate performance of each model endpoint
