Placental\u2010derived cfDNA fragments can enter the\nmaternal bloodstream via apoptosis or necrosis of trophoblasts, where they mix\nwith cfDNA species of maternal origin, the latter mainly originating from\nnormal cells of the hematopoietic lineage [2]. Most NIPT methods rely on\neither whole-genome or targeted sequence analysis of the mixture of cfDNA\nfragments in maternal plasma to screen for the presence of common fetal\ntrisomies 21, 18 and 13 [3]. Since placental-derived cfDNA species exist in a\nhigh background of maternal cfDNA, NIPT findings can be confounded by maternal\n(segmental) chromosomal imbalances [4]. The latter can be constitutional\nmosaicisms or acquired chromosomal aberrations originating from a maternal\nneoplasia. Indeed, malignant as well as benign tumors can shed cell-free tumor\nDNA (ctDNA) fragments into the blood circulatory system [5]. It is now evident\nthat NIPT has the potential to identify tumor-specific copy number alterations\n(CNAs), comprising segmental and/or whole chromosome aneuploidies, and, as a\nconsequence, can indirectly detect (incipient) maternal cancers [3]. As the\nuse of NIPT is increasingly expanding globally for pregnancies with advancing\nmaternal age and its scope is being broadened beyond aneuploidy screening,\nmore aberrant test results caused by a maternal cancer are expected to come to\nthe foreground. Furthermore, whereas most European countries currently offer\nNIPT as a contingency test only in high-risk pregnant women [5], [6],\ncontinuously decreasing costs of NIPT are expected to stimulate changing\npolicies towards implementation of NIPT as a prenatal screening test in a\nbroader population. This has recently also been recommended by ACMG evidence-\nbased guidelines [6]. At present, in Europe, NIPT as a first tier test for the\ngeneral pregnant population is only implemented in Belgium and the Netherlands\n[7], [8].\n\nGiven that malignancies co-occurring with a pregnancy are rare, affecting\nabout 1 in 1000 to 2000 pregnancies [9], a NIPT suggesting a maternal cancer\nis uncommon. Furthermore, certain maternal conditions, like vitamin B12 or\nfolate deficiency or autoimmune diseases, or placental mosaicisms may confound\nthe interpretation of NIPT results with regards to the presence of a maternal\ncancer.\n\nIt is evident that identification of a NIPT suggesting a maternal cancer\nraises a complex and medically, ethically and psychologically challenging\nsituation where the best management options for the mother should be balanced\nagainst safeguarding fetal health. Therefore, general awareness and proper\nunderstanding about the etiologies of aberrant NIPT outcomes among caregiving\nphysicians, including genetic counsellors, obstetricians and oncologists, is\nindispensable for prompt and accurate downstream management of NIPT findings\nthat point to the presence of an occult maternal malignancy.

It can be anticipated that these\nadvancements may also find their way to clinical prenatal testing and can\ncontribute to distinguishing fetal from maternal cfDNA molecules and inform\nabout the origin of cancerous tissues. This would allow organ-targeted imaging\napproaches and thus prevent a diagnostic odyssey.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen identifying discordant NIPT findings, and in particular when these are\ncharacterized by multiple CNAs, a potential maternal cancer should come to\nmind. At present, only retrospective evaluations have been published, thereby\nmaking use of different methods and analysis pipelines and thus preventing an\naccurate deduction of the frequency of these findings. It is apparent that\nidentification of an incipient maternal malignancy is dependent on efficient\ndownstream clinical follow investigations. Yet, currently no standardized\nworkup guidelines exist for such NIPT findings that are suspicious of a\nmaternal cancer. Whereas future analytical and computational advancements in\nthe liquid biopsy field may also be translated to prenatal testing and are\nanticipated to further improve NIPT prediction of maternal neoplasia, ongoing\nlarge-scale prospective evaluations on NIPT and cancer detection are expected\nto provide evidence on the best clinical practices and on whether\nidentification of a cancer via NIPT leads to improved patient outcomes.\nMeanwhile, a clinical management scheme in a multidisciplinary expert setting\nis advocated for NIPT outcomes suggesting an occult maternal malignancy.\n\n", "question": "What is the potential benefit of distinguishing fetal from maternal cfDNA molecules in cancerous tissues?", "answer": "This would allow organ-targeted imaging approaches and thus prevent a diagnostic odyssey."}

As such,\nmolecular barcoding has become crucial in enhancing the confidence of rare\nmutation detection in clinical applications. Safe-SeqS pioneered the use of\nmolecular barcodes [130], assigning a unique identifier (UID) to each template\nmolecule prior to amplification, enabling the identification of mutant PCR\nfragments with over 95 % identical mutations. This approach corrects\namplification and sequencing errors, achieving a sensitivity of 0.05 % allele\nfraction. Molecular barcoding also allows for the recognition of sequencing\nerrors by redundantly sequencing the progeny of each tagged molecule. If all\nprogenies contain the same mutation, it is deemed genuine (a \u2018supermutant\u2019),\nwhile mutations in only a subset of progeny are considered artifacts [130].\nThis technology forms the basis of the Plasma-SeqSensei\u2122 (PSS) ctDNA assays by\nSysmex, which detect 0.07 % and higher VAF with 95 % accuracy amid 10 000\nwild-type copies. They offer IVD kits for breast cancer to aid clinicians in\nmonitoring residual disease, recurrence, and (neo-)adjuvant responses, and for\nsolid cancers, including assessing RAS mutation status for CRC treatment\nsuitability. Additionally, RUO kits are available for detecting mutations in\nNSCLC, melanoma and thyroid, breast, and CRCs.\n\nFurther innovations in barcoding techniques led to additional improvements in\nsensitivity. Molecular barcoding techniques utilize exogenous and endogenous\nbarcodes [130]. Exogenous barcodes, consisting of specified or random\nnucleotides, can be added during library preparation or PCR. On the other\nhand, endogenous barcodes are created by the sequences at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends\nof template fragments and enable duplex sequencing [130,131]. This involves\nligating a semi-degenerated double-stranded unique barcoded adapter to a\ntarget double-stranded DNA, allowing the discernment of both Watson and Crick\nstrands based on their 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 directionality upon sequencing. This method\nsignificantly reduces sequencing errors, as it is unlikely for both strands to\ncontain the same erroneous mutation generated during library preparation or\nsequencing [132]. The theoretical sensitivity of this approach is impressive,\ndetecting one mutant molecule among 10^7, far surpassing conventional NGS\nmethods [133,134]. Various molecular barcoding strategies, using endogenous or\nexogenous barcodes, or a combination of both, have been developed for diverse\nclinical applications [85,89,135\u2013138]. A notable barcoding strategy appends\nidentical exogenous barcodes to both Watson and Crick strands of a template\nmolecule [133], ensuring unambiguous strand identification without relying on\nendogenous sequence ends and maintaining minimal error rates due to duplex\nsequencing.\n\nAlthough this method has the lowest error rate of any sequencing technology\ndescribed to date, two issues have limited its clinical applicability. First,\nit is challenging to convert a large fraction of the initial template\nmolecules to adapter-ligated fragments with the same barcode on each strand\n[126,133,139]. This issue is particularly problematic when the amount of\ninitial DNA is limiting, such as what is often found in liquid biopsy samples.\nSecond, hybridization-based capture is used to enrich desired regions of the\ngenome. While effective for enriching large regions of interest, hybridization\ncapture does not scale well for small target regions [140] and exhibits poor\nduplex recovery [126,139]. Sequential rounds of capture can partially overcome\nthese limitations, but existing hybridization capture-based methods typically\nrecover a minority of input molecules with sequence information from both\nstrands [139,141]. When the targeted region is very small (for example, one or\na few positions in the genome of particular interest) or the amount of DNA\navailable is limited (for example <33 ng, as\n\n", "question": "What technology forms the basis of the Plasma-SeqSensei (PSS) ctDNA assays?", "answer": "Molecular barcoding technology, specifically the Safe-SeqS method, forms the basis of the Plasma-SeqSensei (PSS) ctDNA assays."}

In cases where patients were considered\ninoperable by the investigator, the subsequent treatment plan was a\ncollaborative decision between the investigator and the patient. Prior to\nparticipating in the study, all patients provided written informed consent.\n\nMeasurements and Endpoints\n\nThe primary endpoint was patients who achieved a preoperative endocrine\nprognostic index (PEPI) score of 0. The PEPI score system is a classical\nprognostic score system, which includes tumor size, lymph node status, Ki67\nexpression level, and ER status. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard\nregression model was used to evaluate the independent prognostic relevance of\neach factor, namely, pathological tumor size, pathological node status,\nclinical response, surgical specimen ER status, histological grade, and the\nKi67 level. Hazard ratio (HR) estimates of each factor in the final\nmultivariable model were used to construct a score, the PEPI, for risk of\nrelapse-free survival (RFS) and breast cancer\u2013specific survival (BCSS). The\nPEPI score was derived as an arithmetic sum of risk points weighted by the\nsize of the HR assigned to each statistically significant factor (16). RFS was\ndefined as the interval between random assignment to treatment and the\nearliest subsequent breast cancer event. BCSS was defined as the interval\nbetween random assignment and the date of death after breast cancer relapse.\n\nThe secondary endpoints included complete cell cycle arrest (CCCA, defined as\nKi67 < 2.7%, indicating that the cell cycle progression is completely\nsuppressed), pathological complete response (pCR, indicating no tumor can be\ndetected by pathological examination) rate, objective response rate (ORR, the\nproportion of patients who achieve a specified reduction in tumor volume and\nmaintain it for the minimum duration, including complete response [CR],\npartial response [PR], and stable disease [SD]) assessed by radiography,\ndisease control rate (DCR, the percentage of patients who achieved disease\nresponse and stability after treatment in the total number of evaluable\npatients), BCS, as well as assessing safety and tolerability. Clinical\nresponse was evaluated according to the RECIST criteria14 every 6 weeks using\nCBBCT. The pCR was assessed at the time of surgery, employing the Miller and\nPayne criteria.15 Adverse events (AEs) were graded following the National\nCancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03,\nand the most severe grade experienced by each patient was reported.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nAll analyses were performed using SPSS 22.1 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).\nContinuous data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD and compared by t test.\nCategorical data were expressed as n (%), and compared by the Chi-square test.\nThe primary analysis focused on determining the proportion of patients\nachieving a PEPI 0 patients in this study, and 95% CIs were calculated for\nthis proportion.

Given that Smad2/3 induction of p21 occurs through the\nwell-established canonical Smad signaling pathway shared by all TGF\u03b2 isoforms,\nwe asked whether the synergy observed between TGF\u03b23 and palbociclib could also\nbe observed between TGF\u03b21 and TGF\u03b22 with palbociclib. We tested whether these\nisoforms could confer similar synergistic effects on palbociclib efficacy in\nMDA-MB-231 and SUM159PT cell lines and found that all three TGF\u03b2 isoforms\ndemonstrate a similar effect on palbociclib efficacy (Suppl. Figure 5d). This\nis in line with the proposed mechanism of action underlying the synergy\nbetween TGF\u03b23 and palbociclib, which occurs through a mechanism common to all\nthree isoforms.\n\nIn defining this relationship between Smad2/3 signaling and p21 expression, we\nexamined whether the decrease in p21 observed in palbociclib-treated cells was\nalso mediated through canonical TGF\u03b2 Smad signaling. We observed no added\ncontribution to phosphorylation of Smad2/3 or change in total Smad2/3\nfollowing palbociclib treatment alone or in combination with recTGF\u03b23 (Suppl.\nFigure 5e). Next, we sought to determine whether p21 was at least partially\nresponsible for the synergy observed between palbociclib and TGF\u03b23 by knocking\ndown p21 in 159-R cells using a p21-specific shRNA (Fig. 5e). Using a drug\nmatrix to characterize the drug-response relationship between a range of pairs\nof recTGF\u03b23-palbociclib doses, we found that the synergy scores for the entire\nmatrix tested (\u2018Overall synergy scores\u2019) strongly decreased with all\nalgorithms \u2013 by as much as 34.3% (Bliss) \u2013 in the absence of p21 (Fig. 5f).\nSimilarly, all \u2018Most synergistic area scores\u2019 in p21 knockdown cells decreased\nby as much as 39.2% (Bliss) for a given algorithm (Fig. 5f), highlighting the\ndependence, albeit partial, of TGF\u03b23-palbociclib synergy on p21.\n\nAltogether, we showed that known cell cycle markers, such as CDK4, cyclin D1\nand cyclin E1, are upregulated as early as 2 h following palbociclib\ntreatment, leading to an overall increase in the components necessary for\nactive cyclin/CDK complexes. We also observed a striking decrease in the level\nof p21 upon chronic exposure to palbociclib, highlighting an additional route\nby which cells may become desensitized to palbociclib treatment over time.\nStimulation of these chronically exposed cells (159-R) with TGF\u03b23 increased\np21 levels and overcame the downregulation of p21 induced by chronic exposure\nto palbociclib. Finally, we showed that the TGF\u03b23-mediated increase in p21 is\nSmad2/3-dependent and plays an important role in the synergism observed\nbetween palbociclib and TGF\u03b23 in TNBC.\n\nBased on these findings and previous literature, we propose a mechanistic\nmodel for the synergism between TGF\u03b23 and palbociclib. First, in the basal\ncontext, cells maintain a balance between active (green) and p21-bound\ninactive (red) CDK/cyclin complexes. In the presence of palbociclib, CDK4/6\nkinase activity is blocked by the inhibitor, while p21 bound to CDK4 is\nreleased and displaced to CDK2, inactivating CDK2/cyclin E complexes, and\nleading to cell cycle arrest [39] (Fig. 6a). However, upon prolonged exposure\nto palbociclib, the expression of key cell cycle regulators (CDK4, cyclins D\nand E) is induced while p21 expression is strongly inhibited, as demonstrated\nin Fig. 5b. Considering that the increase in the individual expression of key\nregulators known to bind together, we propose that this implies an increase in\nthe number of complexes formed, and notably, an imbalance in active\nCDK4/cyclin D1 and CDK2/cyclin E1 complexes (Fig. 6b, upper panel).

However, tumor is\nheterogeneous internally, with different regions showing different enhancement\npatterns. Following the methodology of Kim et al. (6, 7), in this study, we\nobtained enhancement curves for individual voxels and classified the tumor\ninto plateau, persistent, and washout subregions. The washout and plateau\nsubregions often correlate with the malignancy of the tumor. Similarly, Ki67,\na marker of cell proliferation, is also associated with the malignancy of\ntumors. Our study was the first to investigate whether the texture features of\nthe malignant subregion (the washout subregion and plateau subregion) could\npredict Ki-67 expression status.\n\nVarious methods were developed to identify the subregions of the tumor, with\nhabitat analysis is the widely used method. The habitat analysis involves\nobtaining quantitative parameters for each voxel within the tumor, such as\nKtrans, Kep, Ve, and Vp from high temporal resolution DCE-MRI, followed by\nclustering algorithms to cluster the voxels into different subregions. This\nsegmentation method has limitations as the subregions\u2019 physiological\ninformation was unclear. Similarly, Fan et al. ever used the subregions in\ntumor to predict the Ki-67 status, although their subregions considering to\nthe pattern of enhancement, but the subregions also didn\u2019t have clear\ndefinition (17). Our approach, based on enhancement curves for subregion\nsegmentation, considered the principles of tumor enhancement. Different\nenhancement types reflected cells with different levels of malignancy, making\nthe segmentation more clinically meaningful.\n\nTexture analysis has been widely used in noninvasive tumor investigation, and\nthe texture features are able to capture the invisible information correlated\nwith clinical outcome or pathological characteristics (18). In this study, we\nclassified texture features into four categories: shape, histogram, second-\norder texture, and high-order texture features. However, as shown in the\nManhattan plot, there weren\u2019t the first-order histogram features and the\nsecond-order texture features significantly differed between high and low\nKi-67 expression cohorts. In contrast, a substantial number of high-order\ntexture features derived from Laplacian of Gaussian and wavelet transformed\nimages showed significant differences between high and low Ki-67 expression\ngroups. This suggested that the malignant subregion, also related to tumor\nmalignancy, was influenced by Ki-67 expression levels. Lower-order features,\nwhich are not visually discernible, do not represent molecular-level\ninformation. In contrast, high-order features captured more detailed\ninformation within lesions and were more sensitive to molecular-level\ndifferences (12).\n\nWe constructed a model for predicting Ki-67 expression levels using support\nvector machine algorithm and evaluated its efficacy with 10-fold cross-\nvalidation. The model\u2019s AUC reached 0.77, with an average AUC of 0.72 for\ncross-validation, suggesting that the machine learning model based on the\nfeatures derived from the malignant subregion could accurately and reliably\npredict Ki-67 expression levels, offering significant diagnostic value for\nbreast cancer.

Clostridium nucleatum has been shown to enhance chemotherapy\nresistance in colorectal cancer by modulating TLRs, microRNA, and autophagy\nnetworks. Bacteroides fragilis, known for inducing Foxp3, a key mediator of\ngastrointestinal immunity and peripheral tolerance, can prompt IL-10-mediated\nmucosal tolerance, leading to the generation of Tregs, while commensal\nmicroorganisms aid in pDCs escape.

Polymyxin B hinders MDSC, diminishes DC and macrophage\nfunctions, and boosts Treg cell activity. Bifidobacterium directly prompts DC\nmaturation and encourages T cells to mount immune responses. Bacillus fragilis\ninduces macrophage polarization towards the M1 phenotype and enhances\nmacrophage phagocytosis.\n\nIntestinal flora can enhance the therapeutic effects of CpG oligonucleotides,\nplatinum compounds, and cyclophosphamide by modulating the function of immune\ncells in TME, influencing immune cell composition, and boosting the activity\nof tumor-infiltrating effector T cells (64\u201366). Bifidobacterium has been shown\nto protect melanoma by supporting anti-PD-L1 therapy (67). Preclinical models\nsuggest that the composition of gut microbiota may improve the efficacy of\nPD-L1 therapy by impacting TME (68). Depletion of gut bacteria can lead to\nimmunogenic changes in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)\nmicroenvironment, including increased differentiation of myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells (MDSCs) and M1-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), as\nwell as the activation of CD4+ Th1 and CD8+ T cells, which can enhance the\neffectiveness of checkpoint immunotherapy by increasing PD-1 expression (67).\nIL-25 has been found to activate M2 TAMs, induce the expression of chemokine\nCXCL10, and promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocellular\ncarcinoma (HCC), thereby facilitating tumor progression and metastasis (69).\nResearchers have observed that depletion of intestinal flora leads to an\nincrease in Th1 (INF\u03b3)+CD4+CD3+ and Tc1 (INF\u03b3)+CD8+CD3+ cells, while the\nnumber of IL-17A and IL-10-secreting cells decreases (70).

The analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) shows that gastric cancer\npatients with FGFR2 amplification have significantly shorter OS than those\nwithout FGFR2 amplification [43]. FGFR autophosphorylation (Tyr653/654 cyclic\nphosphorylation) is significantly increased in cell lines with high levels of\nFGFR2 amplification (arbitrarily defined as FISH ratio > 5), leading to FGFR\nhyperactivation [43]. Patients with high levels of FGFR2 amplification are\nthought to be likely to respond to FGFR inhibitors, but this occurs in only 5%\nof GC [43]. Studies have shown that FGFR1 is amplified in 19% of lung squamous\ncell carcinoma cases (14/73) and is more common in poorly differentiated\ntumors, suggesting a possible role in tumor aggressiveness [44]. Of these, 50%\n(7/14) showed high amplification (defined as real-time PCR fold greater than\ntenfold). And patients with high copy numbers showed better response rates to\nthe FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 [45].

These mutation\nsites are mainly located in the kinase domain of FGFR1 and are associated with\nabnormal activation of FGFR1 and various diseases, including cancer.

Previous investigations evaluated possible functions of\nexosomes isolated from the IMMUNEPOTENT CRP in silico (Franco-Molina et al.,\n2016) by our research group, proposing a role in biological processes such as\nwound healing. The study involved both in vitro and in vivo evaluations,\nrevealing distinct cellular responses to ICRP components. First, we created a\nconditioned medium for HUVEC cells obtained from human peripheral whole blood\npreviously treated with 0.5 U of ICRP; this induces a greater proliferation in\nHUVEC cells compared to the control. This technique is based on the molecules\nthat a cell can secrete under treatment, with the potential of inducing\nproliferation.\n\nDifferent types of stimuli can promote the activation of biological functions\nrelated to survival. It has been reported that stimulating mononuclear cells\nfrom cord blood with radiation promotes a pro-angiogenic effect on progenitor\nendothelial cells in vitro (Cervio et al., 2013). Exosomes derived from rat\nplasma on irradiated macrophages induced angiogenesis (HUVEC cells) by\nstimulating the immune microenvironment (Li et al., 2021). On the other hand,\nmesenchymal cells are present in the stroma of various tissues and organs, for\nexample, the spleen and umbilical cord. These cells secrete factors that can\nbe used as a conditioned medium for culture-starved HUVEC cells, inducing\nproliferation and anti-apoptotic effect. These conditions of stress and\nhypoxia are present in a diabetic foot ulcer, in which the malformation of\nvessels (Bader et al., 2014) is a key target to treatment for inducing\ncellular regeneration. Likewise, platelet-rich plasma has been tested in\nfibroblast and keratinocytes in an ex vivo model, inducing proliferation and\naccelerating scratch wound closure, due to the presence of growth factors and\ncytokines (Stessuk et al., 2016; Bakadia et al., 2023).

{"id": "PMC11150340-0", "context": "Introduction\n\nImmunotherapy has emerged as one of the most promising cancer treatments. Its\nassumption is to reactivate, modulate and strengthen body\u2019s own immune system\nto eliminate tumor cells. Immunotherapy uses cytokines, chemokines, and immune\ncells to reshape the tumor microenvironment (TME), leading to potent anti-\ntumor effects as well as prevents tumor recurrence. Cancer immunotherapy\nmethods include, among others: monoclonal antibodies (checkpoint mAbs,\ntherapeutic mAbs), small molecule drugs (targeting PD-1/PD-L1 axis, STING\nagonists, CXCRs inhibitors), adoptive cell therapy (CAR-T, TCR-T, TILs, CAR-\nNK) oncolytic viruses (adenoviruses, HSV-1) and cancer vaccines (dendritic\ncells stimulated ex vivo) [1]. Compared to standard cancer treatments\n(including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery), cancer immunotherapy\nresults in significant improvements for patients in terms of progression-free\nsurvival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and quality of life. Therefore,\nimmunotherapy has become the first line treatment for numerous cancer types.\nAlthough effective immunotherapies have been reported, statistically only a\nsmall minority (20\u201340%) of patients benefit from them [2]. The major\nlimitations are immune-related adverse events, cytokine storm, patients low\nresponse rate or acquired resistance mechanisms. Therefore, further\nimprovements for cancer immunotherapies are crucially needed. One of the\nimmunotherapy methods, intensively developed in recent years, is activation of\ncGAS-STING pathway. It acts as innate immunity activator, sensing cytosolic\nDNA and inducing expression of genes encoding type I interferons and pro-\ninflammatory cytokines via the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-\u03baB,\nrespectively. Several types of STING agonists have been found, divided into\nthree categories: (1) cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs, including cGAMP), (2)\nflavonoids (DMXAA and its analogs), (3) small molecule agonists. STING\nstimulators have been tested in preclinical models and some in clinical trials\nand have shown reduced tumor growth and tumor clearance capability [3].\nHowever, in many refractory tumor models, targeting STING protein results in\ninsufficient or unsustainable anti-tumor response. To enhance the\neffectiveness of cancer immunotherapy, combination of various therapeutic\nstrategies seems essential to achieve synergistic systemic anti-tumor\nresponse.\n\nTargeting tumor vasculature effectively reduces tumor burden. There are two\ntypes of agents targeting tumor vasculature: inhibitors of new capillaries\nformation (anti-angiogenic agents, AAs) or agents that destroy existing tumor\nblood vessels (vascular disrupting agents, VDAs). Destruction of endothelial\ncells leads to vascular system disruption and tumor cell necrosis through\ninhibition of oxygen and nutrition supply. VDAs divide into three groups: (1)\nMicrotubule destabilizing drugs (combretastatins e.g. CA4P), (2) Flavonoids\nwith anti-vascular functions (DMXAA), (3) Drugs targeting endothelial cells\nreceptors (e.g. peptide RGD-(KLAKLAK2)) [4]. Most drugs in the latter group\ntarget receptors that are overexpressed on tumor endothelial cells, like \u03b1v\u03b23\nintegrin or VEGF receptor. Their ligands are tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) or\nVEGF protein, respectively. These agents are composed of cognitive subunit and\neffector-toxin domain that after internalization effectively kill target\ncells. One example is the construct of RGD domain with proapoptotic peptide\n(KLAKLAK)2 that specifically binds to \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin. Once bound, the peptide\ninternalizes inside the cell, where the cytotoxic domain (KLAKLAK)2 causes\nbinding and destruction of the mitochondrial membrane, leading to death of\nendothelial cells.\n\n", "question": "What is the main goal of cancer immunotherapy?", "answer": "The main goal of cancer immunotherapy is to reactivate, modulate and strengthen the body\u2019s own immune system to eliminate tumor cells."}

They thus have a distinctive\npotential to trigger robust antitumor immunity in cancer. Based on its\ncharacteristics, human and mouse DCs are generally categorized as conventional\nDC1s (cDC1s), conventional DC2s (cDC2s), plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), and\nmonocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) (Wculek et al., 2020). cDC1s development rely on\nIRF8, ID2, and BATF3, which are transcription factors that selectively express\nthe chemokine receptor XCR1 and the lectin receptor CLEC9A. cDC1s capture and\ntransport tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) to tumor-draining lymph nodes and\nthen efficiently cross-present TAAs through MHC-I to initiate tumor-specific\nCD8+ T cell responses (B\u00f6ttcher and Reis E Sousa, 2018). Tumor-infiltrating\ncDC1s secrete CXCL10 to recruit CD8+ T cells and regulate cell functions by\nsecreting T cell-associated cytokines (Spranger et al., 2017; Hubert et al.,\n2020). cDC2s require the transcription factors RELB, IRF4, and ZEB2 and are\nmainly involved in MHC-II-dependent antigen presentation in tumor-draining\nlymph nodes to initiate CD4+ T cells (Wculek et al., 2020). pDCs development\ndepend on IRF8 and E2-2 expression and play a crucial role in antitumor\nimmunity because of their robust capacity to produce IFN-I. Paradoxically,\nother studies showed that pDCs infiltration in the tumor microenvironment\n(TME) was associated with impaired IFN-I secretion, T cell response\nsuppression, and Treg expansion, which ultimately leads to tumor immune escape\n(Reizis, 2019). Although MoDCs are mostly differentiated from monocytes in\nperipheral tissues during inflammation, they also have the similar ability to\npresent antigens to CD8+ T cells (Wculek et al., 2020).\n\nChromosome instability is one of cancer hallmarks. It is characterized by\nchromosome segregation errors during mitosis, which results in micronuclei\nformation. Indeed, when genomic DNA (gDNA)-containing micronuclei ruptures,\ntumor DNA is exposed (Crasta et al., 2012). Along with the nuclear\ncompartment, mitochondria is an additional source of genomic material, and\nmitochondrial dysfunction results in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release.\nFurthermore, spontaneous tumor cell death and cancer therapy-induced\nimmunogenic death increase the ability of immune cells to access these tumor-\nassociated DNA (Ahmed and Tait, 2020). Innate immune cells use limited\nrepertoires of germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to\nidentify conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-\nassociated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Recently, DNA immunostimulatory\nproperties have garnered substantial attention after the first sensor with DNA\nrecognition was identified. The immunosensing of DNA has evolved to induce\nhost immune responses in response to the invasion and exposure of exogenous\nnucleic acids (Hornung and Latz, 2010). Thus, DNA sensing is a pivotal player\nin antitumor immunity. Defects in the DNA sensing pathway are associated with\ntumor progression, and treatment using DNA sensor-targeting agonists can be a\npromising cancer therapeutic strategy (Woo et al., 2014; McWhirter and\nJefferies, 2020).\n\nIn this review, we focus on the specific mechanisms in which DCs employ DNA\nsensors to recognize tumor-derived DNA and initiate an antitumor immune\nresponse.

The findings\nsuggested that PD-1 treatment could be more effective in the lower-risk\npopulation ( Figure 7E ). However, there was no significant alteration between\nthe two risk subgroups in anti-CTLA4 responsiveness. We further evaluated the\nseven steps of the immune cycle and observed substantial variations between\nthe two types (34) ( Figure 7F ). The risk score was adversely linked with the\ndegree of expression of immune inhibitors PD1, PD-L1, HAVCR2, LAG3, and CTLA-4\n( Figure 7G ).

As a result, the pursuit of potentially\ndruggable therapeutic targets for GB patients grappling with dismal prognoses\nwas initiated. In this endeavor, a compilation of target information\nencompassing 6,125 compounds was amassed.

For this experiment, we use a second\ncohort of mice and compare blood from two treated to two untreated mice. We\nsequence 7503 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and after quality\ncontrol end up with 5794 high-quality cells. The cell-type annotation\nhighlights five different main cell types: B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T\ncells, plasmablasts and NK cells (Figures 5A,5B).

However, this study did not find\nany significant relationship between FR\u03b1 expression and prognosis.\nNevertheless, this study highlights the importance of this receptor in other\ngynecologic subtypes like carcinosarcoma.\n\nThe idea of using more targeted agents in rare gynecologic malignancies has\ngenerated a great deal of interest in the medical field. One example of this\napproach is the use of eribulin ADCs, which have been previously used to\nminimize toxicity while maximizing treatment efficacy in rare gynecologic\ncancers such as ovarian carcinosarcoma, uterine serous carcinoma, and ovarian\nclear-cell adenocarcinoma [22]. Farletuzumab ecteribulin is an ADC that uses\nusing this method, with MORAb-109 targeting eribulin to mesothelin. This\napproach has been studied in newer trials, as shown by Vandenberg et al. [22].\nThis idea is important because many of these rare gynecologic malignancies\nhave poor overall responses, and finding novel ways to treat them can offer\nhope for our patients.\n\nIn this article, we will address the advent of MIRV based on the SOYAYA study,\nwhich has made significant clinical progress in bypassing platinum-resistant\novarian cancer. There is an unmet need for effective treatment of patients\nwith platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, and many studies are being conducted\nto expand on this idea. For instance, Luveltamab tazevibulin (luvelta) is a\nnovel FR\u03b1-targeting ADC with a hemiasterlin warhead (DAR4) that showed\nefficacy in a phase 1 study in 32 patients with relapsed or advanced\nepithelial ovarian cancer with broad FR\u03b1 expression, with an ORR of 37.5%\n[23].\n\nIn a phase 1/2 study of rinatibet sesutecan (Rina-S) known as the PRO1184-001\nstudy, another new ADC targeting FR\u03b1 was tested in patients with locally\nadvanced and/or metastatic solid tumors like ovarian tumors, NSCLC, breast and\nendometrial tumors, or mesothelioma. This first-in-human trial (NCT05579366)\nshowed that the novel ADC has a relatively safe profile and promising efficacy\n[24].\n\nThe use of FR\u03b1 expression and targeting through ADC has established a\npromising future direction for oncology, particularly in the field of\ngynecologic malignancies. It offers the potential to enhance safety and\nefficacy, even in platinum-resistant, advanced, or rare malignancies. This\napproach could pave the way for treating other malignancies that express FR\u03b1,\nwhich would be a revolutionary development in cancer treatment.\n\n3\\. Role of FR\u03b1 in Other Cancer Types\n\nIt has been observed that many types of cancer exhibit over-expression of FR\u03b1.\nA study of 320 surgical NSCLC tissues revealed that adenocarcinomas,\nespecially epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutants, had higher\nexpression of FR\u03b1 compared to squamous-cell carcinomas. Tumors in non-smokers\nand early-stage tumors also had higher expression of FR\u03b1, suggesting that it\nmay be a promising target in NSCLC [25]. In another study of colon cancer, FR\u03b1\npositivity was higher in carcinomas (44% in metastatic and to 33% in\nprimaries) compared to normal colon tissue or adenomas (7%) (p < 0.001) [26].\nOther cancers with high FR\u03b1 expression include mesotheliomas, gynecologic\nmalignancies, breast cancers, and head and neck cancers. These findings are\nimportant, as they expand the scope of potential treatment applications from\ngynecologic malignancies to many other cancer subtypes.\n\nNumerous studies have explored the use of the FR\u03b1 receptor across various\ntypes of cancer.

Although GSK145A is not a specific noncovalent inhibitor of\nUBC9-dependent SUMOylation, it acts as a competitive substrate of SUMOylation,\nblocking the substrate recognition for Tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome type I\nprotein (TRPS1) 126. Compound 2, a synthesized UBC9-binding compound\nidentified by small-molecule microarray (SMM)-based screening using\nfluorescently tagged UBC9, prevents the SUMOylation of RanGAP1 127.\nAdditionally, WNN0605-F008 disturbs the catalytic activity of UBC9 via\noccupying its catalytic pocket, leading to the inhibition of RanGAP1\nSUMOylation 128.\n\nAltogether, the advancement of high-throughput screening assays has led to the\ndiscovery of inhibitors for the \u201cundruggable\u201d E2 enzyme UBC9. However, their\nclinical value requires further evaluation.\n\nSUMO E3 inhibitors\n\nSUMO E3-ligases ensure the specificity of target substrates and facilitate the\ntransfer of SUMOs from the E2 conjugating enzyme to the substrates.\nUnfortunately, small-molecule inhibitors for SUMO E3-ligases are scarce.\nUNC3866 is one such inhibitor that binds preferentially to the CBX\nchromodomains of SUMO E3-ligase CBX4, inhibiting PC3 prostate cancer cells\n129. Additionally, UNC3866 exerts a powerful anti-tumor effect via hindering\nCBX4, contributing to the suppression of tumor cell growth and cancer stem\ncell properties 130. Further development of SUMO E3 inhibitors with enhanced\nspecificity is needed to disrupt the SUMOylation cascade effectively.\n\nSUMO protease inhibitors\n\nSUMO proteases act as both oncogenes and anti-oncogenes. In some tumors, the\nhigh expression of partial SUMO proteases exacerbates the malignant\nphenotypes, making them anti-tumor targets. Therefore, several natural and\nsynthetic small-molecule inhibitors targeting SENP1 and SENP2 have been\nidentified. For instance, streptonigrin, a natural product, directly binds to\nSENP1, thwarting its interaction with SUMO1 and leading to the diminution of\nhypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF1\u03b1) 131.

Correspondingly, several synthetic small-molecule compounds, such as GN6958 134, compound 3 135, and compound 13m 136, have also been developed to inhibit SENP1 activity; however, further verification is warranted using in vivo studies. Furthermore, three SENP2 inhibitors have been developed, namely ebselen 137, Compound 69 and 117 138. However, there is no evidence that these SENP2 inhibitors exert anti-tumor properties.\n\nTaken together, SUMO proteases play dual roles in the SUMOylation cascade,\ninvolving promoting the SUMO maturation and expediting the SUMO deconjugation.\nThus, inhibiting SUMO proteases may induce the antithetical outcomes of the\nSUMOylation cascade. Therefore, the anti-tumor effect of SUMO protease\ninhibitors requires not only in vivo and in vitro verification but also\nfurther clinical validation.\n\nAn in vivo study reported that loss of Ubc9 in adult mice can lead to severe\ndiarrhea or death 139, indicating that SUMOylation inhibitors may possess\npotential toxicity and induce adverse effects. Moreover, the unanticipated\ntumor-suppressive role of SUMOylation may have significant implications for\nthe appropriate use of SUMOylation inhibitors in clinical practice 140.\n\nIn summary, while most SUMOylation inhibitors hold promise in anti-tumor\ntreatment, their potential toxicity and unexpected side effects necessitate\nfurther investigation. Considering the dual role of SUMOylation in tumors and\nphysiological homeostasis, it is crucial to assess the safety and efficacy of\nthese inhibitors comprehensively before their clinical use.\n\nConclusions and perspective\n\nSUMOylation, as one of the critical PTMs, modulates protein function and\nlocalization, exerting tremendous influence on tumor initiation and\nprogression. SUMOs are covalently conjugated to the lysine (K) residues of\nproteins with a SUMOylation consensus motif.

Third, what\nother cellular stress can induce SUMOylation in tumors? Fourth, what specific\nfunctions does each SUMO E3 ligase perform? Will there be new SUMO E3 ligases\nidentified? Fifth, why does SUMOylation degrade substrate protein in some\ncases? Is this protein degradation induced by specific SUMO E3 ligase-mediated\nSUMOylation? With the development of multi-omics sequencing and deep learning,\na better understanding of protein SUMOylation will be provided in future\nyears.\n\nIn tumors, the SUMOylation cascade possesses the characteristic of\nexacerbating the cancer progression relying on its multifunctional biological\neffects, such as regulating transcriptional activity, increasing protein\nstability, etc. Intriguingly, SUMOylation can be triggered by\n\n", "question": "What is the role of SUMOylation in tumor progression?", "answer": "SUMOylation exacerbates cancer progression by regulating transcriptional activity, increasing protein stability, etc."}

The antitumor functions of Tim3.KD.MSLN-\nCAR T cells, as well as MSLN-CAR T cells, including cytotoxicity,\nproliferation, and cytokine production, significantly decreased in the\npresence of NECA. A2aR knockdown in A2aR.KD.MSLN-CAR T cells could maintain\nCAR T cell function in the presence of NECA, as previously reported by Masoumi\net al. Since the main purpose of our in vitro study was to evaluate the\neffects of double knockdown of Tim3 and A2a receptors on the antitumor\nfunction of MSLN-CAR T cells, we compared the antitumor capacity of\nTim3/A2aR.KD.MSLN-CAR T cells with a single KD.MSLN-CAR T cells. We found that\ndouble KD.MSLN-CAR T cells showed similar antitumor functions in the presence\nand absence of NECA.

Therefore, to better understand\nthis finding, we investigated the interplay between A2aR and Tim3 expression\non the surface of CAR T cells. We found that the expression of A2aR was\nsignificantly reduced in CAR T cells with A2aR shRNA3 compared to MSLN-CAR T\ncells without A2aR shRNA, consistent with previous findings (10). However, the\nTim3-shRNA failed to effectively and significantly downregulate Tim3 molecule,\nwhich is opposed to a previous study (11). This inconsistency may be due to\nthe unique characteristics of T lymphocytes in different donors. Activation of\nCAR T cells has been shown to increase the expression of inhibitory receptors\nsuch as Tim3 (11, 28, 33) and A2aR (10, 30, 34) in previous studies, and our\nstudy also showed that the expression of Tim3 and A2aR molecules both\nincreased on the surface of MSLN-CAR T cells after stimulation with HeLa\ncells. Interestingly, knockdown of Tim3 or A2aR did not affect their\nreciprocal expression, whereas previous studies have shown that inhibiting one\ninhibitory receptor can increase the compensatory expression of other\ninhibitory receptors. For instance, Leone et al. showed that A2aR inhibition\nwith CPI-444 downregulates the expression of inhibitory receptors, including\nTim3, Lag3, and PD1 (35). In another study, it was observed that PD1\ninhibition increases the compensatory expression of Tim3 (36). Nevertheless,\nthese differences may be due to differences in the source of T cells, the\nmethod of inhibition (genetic vs. pharmacological inhibition), and testing\ncontext (in vitro versus in vivo).

However, while there is extensive\navailable literature on how AI changes health care in general, the influence\non nursing in long-term care is less commonly discussed [19,20]. Especially in\nmore clinical settings, the use of AI is further developed and already being\nused; for instance, for breast cancer detection in screening mammography [21].\nFrom previous research, the reception of the prospect of a more AI-involved\nfuture for nursing has been mixed, with concerns having been expressed\nregarding the complexity of AI and how its use may affect human interaction\nand professional autonomy [20,22,23]. This has been especially well-studied\namong nursing students, who can reasonably expect to see more AI used during\ntheir careers [23,24]. Given the relative newness of this area, the precise\nimpact of AI on the nursing field in long-term care is still up in the air.\nThe potential impact includes opportunities for in-home assessment of\npatients, offering greater time savings and convenience for both patients and\nhealth care professionals such as nurses [15,25-28]. This aspect of time\nsavings could also be helpful given the shortage of nurses [29] as the use of\ntechnology could potentially reduce the nursing workload [30]. Furthermore,\nthe general provision of more evidence-based, personalized care based on\nalgorithmically derived health information [19,31] can help to overcome\nintuitively based decisions. The advantage of automation is the ability to\ntake away some of the repetitive drudgery of background work, such as\ngathering information and administration, as this is handled by the algorithm.\nRather, professionals can spend more time on directly action-oriented tasks\n[31].\n\nAI-Driven Lifestyle Monitoring System\n\nThis paper will focus on the use of AI-driven lifestyle monitoring systems\nsuch as those often implemented in smart living environments and smart homes\n[32].

For instance, only one in\nfour LCBM patients survives beyond 1 year after diagnosis. 3 For BCBM, the\n1\u2010year survival rate is approximately 20%. 4 Despite advances in targeted\ntherapy and immunotherapy, only a limited number of BM patients benefit from\nthese novel treatment methods. 5 Moreover, improvements in primary tumor\ncontrol and an aging population contribute to the elevated incidence of BM. 6\nTherefore, early detection and diagnosis are important in BM management.\n\nSeveral previous studies focused on exploring risk indicators for BM. As they\ndemonstrated, molecular features are one of the critical factors that affect\nBM incidence. LC patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)\nmutation 7 and BC patients whose human epidermal growth factor receptor 2\n(HER2) is positive 8 tend to develop BM more frequently.

It\nfunctions as a cystine/glutamate antiporter responsible for importing cystine\ninto the cell in exchange for glutamate. Cystine is subsequently reduced to\ncysteine, a crucial constituent of GSH. The classical ferroptosis inducers,\nerastin and RSL3, act as inhibitors of system xc\u2212 and GPX4, respectively,\nunderscoring the significance of the system xc\u2212-GSH-GPX4 pathway in\nsuppressing ferroptosis [9, 97, 98]. Due to its ubiquitous expression across\nvarious cell types, directly targeting GPX4 with covalent inhibitors may lead\nto significant adverse effects, potentially limiting the therapeutic utility\nof such inhibitors [99]. The transsulfuration pathway of methionine provides\ncancer cells with GSH to evade ferroptosis caused by cysteine deprivation.\nConversely, intermittent dietary methionine deprivation significantly\nincreases ferroptosis sensitivity in various tumor models [100].\n\nGPX4 exhibits a multifaceted role not only in ferroptosis but also in other\nforms of cell death, such as apoptosis [101], necroptosis [102] and pyroptosis\n[103]. This versatility stems from GPX4\u2019s involvement in various cellular\nhomeostasis and stress response pathways. Similarly, genetic depletion or\npharmacological inhibition (e.g., using HG106) of SLC7A11 can trigger non-\nferroptotic cell death in KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinoma or melanoma [104,\n105]. GSH can inhibit cuproptosis through its capacity to chelate copper\n[106]. These findings demonstrate the context-dependent role of the\nSLC7A11-GSH-GPX4 pathway in cell death. Similarly, using GSH depletion may not\nadequately reflect ferroptosis.\n\nGPX4-independent pathway\n\nAmong the increasingly reported GPX4-independent pathways, apoptosis inducing\nfactor mitochondria associated 2 (AIFM2, also known as FSP1) emerges as a\ncentral regulator. Initially identified as a positive regulator of\nmitochondrial apoptosis, AIFM2 translocates from mitochondria to the plasma\nmembrane in GPX4-low-expressing cancer cells when stimulated with ferroptosis\ninducers (e.g., RSL3 and ML162) [107, 108]. This translocation positions AIFM2\nas a repressor of ferroptosis through an integrated mechanism, involving the\nproduction of reduced coenzyme Q10 (CoQH2) [107, 108] and reduced vitamin K\n(VKH2) [109, 110], as well as mediating ESCRT-III-dependent membrane repairs\n[111]. Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 like 1 (VKORC1L1)\ngenerates a reduced form of vitamin K that counteracts phospholipid peroxides\nand protects human pancreatic and melanoma cells from ferroptosis response\nindependent of the GSH-GPX4 pathway [112]. AIFM2\u2019s function in ferroptosis is\nreliant on phase separation, initiated by N-terminal myristoylation at S187,\nL217, and Q319, facilitated by the compound icFSP1 [110].

{"id": "PMC11166456-5", "context": "homeostasis regulates cancer cell survival and growth\n\nIron and iron-binding proteins are essential to sustaining cell proliferation\nthrough regulation of mitochondrial metabolism, DNA synthesis and repair, and\nlysosomal activity (Galy et al., 2024; Weber et al., 2020). Iron ions are\ntransported by transferrin and constitutively internalised by the transferrin\nreceptor. Once internalised, iron is trafficked through the endo-lysosomal\nsystem, where it is processed, after which free iron ions are released (Shen\net al., 2018). Cancer cells adapt iron homeostasis to support an increased\nneed for biosynthesis and energy, and the number of transferrin receptors\npresent on a cell strongly correlates with the rate of cell proliferation\n(Chitambar et al., 1983; Neckers and Trepel, 1986; Richardson, 2002).\nUpregulation of the transferrin receptor is associated with poor outcomes in a\nrange of cancer types, including breast cancer (Khoo et al., 2020), leukaemia\n(Hagag et al., 2018) and advanced prostate cancer (O'Donnell et al., 2006).\nHowever, excess intracellular non-transferrin-bound iron can result in\ntoxicity due to formation of oxygen radicals and damage to lipids and DNA,\nwhich creates a potential vulnerability in tumour cells (Galy et al., 2024).\nThe iron-dependent peroxidation of lipids, particularly phospholipids, is\nhallmark of ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death in which the\nperoxidation of phospholipids causes plasma membrane rupture (Dixon et al.,\n2012). This can be combated by adaptations in plasma membrane repair\nmechanisms dependent on the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport\nIII (ESCRT-III) leading to resistance to ferroptosis as shown in pancreatic\nand liver cancer cell lines and in vivo (Dai et al., 2020). The ESCRT\ncomplexes mediate multiple membrane trafficking and remodelling processes,\nmany of which might also contribute to tumorigenesis and tumour progression\n(see Box 2). Although many cancer cells adapt to evade apoptosis by\nupregulating anti-apoptotic proteins, ferroptosis is often lethal for cancer\ncells; indeed, drugs that increase lysosomal release of free iron to induce\nferroptosis have shown promising results in pancreatic cancer models in vitro\nand have the potential to provide a new way of killing cancer cells that are\nresistant to existing therapies (Antoszczak et al., 2022; Mai et al., 2017).\nUnderstanding the intricate balance of iron homeostasis in cancer cells,\nwherein trafficking of the transferrin receptor plays a pivotal role, reveals\nnot only its crucial involvement in supporting biosynthesis and meeting energy\nneeds but also its potential as a vulnerability of tumour cells. The complex\ninterplay between iron-dependent processes, such as ferroptosis, and ESCRT-\nIII-dependent plasma membrane repair mechanisms presents an intriguing avenue\nfor developing innovative therapeutic strategies, particularly for cancer\ncells resistant to conventional therapies.\n\n", "question": "What is the role of iron homeostasis in cancer cells?", "answer": "Iron homeostasis is essential for cancer cell survival and growth, as it supports biosynthesis and energy needs.

Although there is strong\nevidence for overexpression of COPI subunits in multiple kinds of cancer, the\ndifferent mechanistic advantages this provides for cancer progression are\nstill being uncovered. Current evidence suggests that COPI regulates\nautophagy, lysosomal activity, lipid homeostasis and retrograde transport of\nEGFR in cancer cells, and future research should focus on generating\nadditional insights into the specific impacts of overexpression of COPI in a\nrange of cancer subtypes.\n\nAdaptations in membrane trafficking impact responses to cancer therapies\n\nEvasion of cell death through intrinsic and/or extrinsic apoptosis is another\nhallmark of cancer cells (Hanahan, 2022). Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are\ncommon treatment options for many cancer patients; in addition, in recent\nyears cancer immunotherapy has become an important treatment avenue (Pasello\net al., 2020; Sperandio et al., 2021). However, all cancer treatments are\nassociated with mechanisms of resistance and recurrence, and it is therefore\nessential to understand the mechanisms underlying adaptations that allow\ncancer cells to resist cell death (Gutwillig et al., 2022; Jayashankar and\nEdinger, 2020; Tonnessen-Murray et al., 2019). Here, we will explore\nresistance mechanisms associated with two major types of chemotherapy that\ntarget dividing cells by impeding nucleotide synthesis or inducing DNA\ncrosslinking. First, we will look at 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which is employed\nin treating colorectal, breast, and pancreatic cancers by impeding DNA\nsynthesis, reducing production of thymidine (an essential DNA component) and\ndisrupting DNA repair processes, ultimately leading to programmed cell death.\nSecond, we examine platinum-based chemotherapy (e.g. cisplatin and\ncarboplatin), which is utilised in treating ovarian, bladder, lung and\noesophageal cancers, and has a mechanism of action involves crosslinking of\npurine bases on DNA, which interferes with DNA replication and causes DNA\ndamage, consequently triggering apoptosis. Finally, we will discuss resistance\nmechanisms associated with emerging cancer immunotherapy treatments, which\npromote activity of T cells against cancer cells.\n\nResistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis via endocytic adatpations\n\nAs discussed above, cancer cells can resist chemotherapy-induced apoptosis by\nentering senescence. Senescent cancer cells can form a cell population that\ncan reinitiate proliferation and form more aggressive and tumorigenic clones\n(Saleh et al., 2020; Tonnessen-Murray et al., 2019). By endocytosing and\ndegrading membranes, protein and DNA from a live neighbouring cell, senescent\ncells can generate a pool of lipids, amino acids and nucleotides and bypass\nthe intrinsic synthesis pathways that might be subject to inhibition by\nchemotherapies (Fig. 3) (Tonnessen-Murray et al., 2019). This mechanism is\nimportant in treatment resistance, as many chemotherapies induce cell death\nthrough\n\n", "question": "What is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) used for in treating cancers?", "answer": "5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is used for treating colorectal, breast, and pancreatic cancers."}

Notably, previous studies reported that the NF2 tumor\nsuppressor gene product, Merlin, functions as an upstream negative regulator\nof DCAF1 (VprBP) [22]. Additionally, Poulose et al. reported that DCAF1\n(VprBP) is regulated by the androgen receptor at the transcript level, and by\nO-GlcNAc transferase at the protein level [21], providing potential insight\nfor further study.\n\nMounting evidence indicates that glucose deficiency often leads to cell death\nin fast-growing cancer cells. To overcome the stress of glucose deprivation\nand support cell survival, cancer cells have developed various mechanisms [1],\nincluding autophagy, to sustain themselves under low glucose conditions [45,\n46, 78, 79], and it is often observed in poorly vascularized sites of solid\ntumors [80]. The regulation of glucose deprivation-induced protective\nautophagy involves multiple pathways [45, 46, 78, 79, 81, 82], with the mTORC1\ncomplex being a well-known negative regulator of autophagy [53, 83]. In\naddition to the classical AMPK-mTORC1 pathway [45, 84, 85], other mechanisms\nhave been identified. For instance, HK-II binding to TORC1 suppresses mTORC1\nactivity and promotes protective autophagy in response to glucose deprivation\n[8]. Glucose deprivation could induce \u03b2-catenin degradation and lead to\nautophagy [82]. The accumulation of DEPTOR, an mTOR inhibitor, also leads to\nautophagy as a cellular protective mechanism [4, 7]. In this study, we\nuncovered that DCAF1-mediated Rheb degradation and mTORC1 inactivation\ncontribute to cancer cell survival under glucose deprivation conditions. It is\nworth noting that previous studies have also reported that Rheb inhibition\nduring cellular stress triggers adaptive mechanisms such as cell cycle arrest,\nautophagy, and growth inhibition to play a protective role [10, 86]. For\nexample, Rheb inactivation during glucose deprivation promotes cardiomyocyte\nsurvival by activating autophagy [10]. Furthermore, the Rheb/p27 axis,\nindependent of mTORC1, has been suggested to activate autophagy and promote\ncancer cell survival under serum deprivation [87]. In our study, we observed\nthat transactivated DCAF1 significantly triggered autophagy during glucose\ndeprivation. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence\ndemonstrating the role of DCAF1 as a positive regulator of autophagy in the\nabsence of glucose by suppressing the Rheb-mTORC1 pathway. However, we also\nobserved that DCAF1 only partially rescued glucose deprivation-induced\napoptosis and promoted cell survival, suggesting the involvement of other\nunderlying mechanisms.\n\nIn summary, our study identified DCAF1 as a novel cellular glucose sensor and\ndemonstrated its involvement in cancer cell survival under glucose deprivation\nconditions. Mechanistically, glucose deprivation transactivated DCAF1, which\npromoted K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of\n\n", "question": "What is the role of DCAF1 in cancer cell survival under glucose deprivation conditions?", "answer": "DCAF1 acts as a positive regulator of autophagy in the absence of glucose by suppressing the Rheb-mTORC1 pathway, promoting cancer cell survival under glucose deprivation conditions."}

Considering the cost and challenge of producing\nand making available in the small oncology veterinary market caninized\nmonoclonal antibodies, an in vitro study was conducted to investigate the\npotential human-dog cross-reactivity of approved human ICI [91].\n\nSeven FDA-approved human ICIs against the main targets CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1\nwere tested in dogs in vitro. The author used flow cytometry and ELISA to\nevaluate cross-reactivity and blocking capacity while evaluating functional\nresponses and cytokine formation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)\nobtained from dogs with cancer (n = 27) and healthy donors (n = 12). The study\nfound that four out of seven human ICI monoclonal antibodies were cross-\nreactive, and especially atezolizumab and avelumab showed blocking activity of\nthe canine PD1/PD-L1 axis. Atezolizumab also achieved significant functional\nbenefits when used in cPBMC activation in vitro assays, increasing cIFN-\u03b3\nproduction in both samples from healthy and cancer patients and showing a\nsimilar binding profile to canine PD-L1 when compared to human PD-L1. The\nauthor concluded that this in vitro study provides the rationale for clinical\ntesting of atezolizumab in dogs. Despite the author acknowledging that being\nan in vitro study, adverse events or the development of anti-drug antibodies\ncould not be predicted, it also argues that studies investigating the\npharmacokinetic parameters of other humanised monoclonal antibodies have\nalready been performed and did not show significant anti-drug antibodies that\nresulted in noticeable decreases in drug concentration, and neither severe\nadverse events nor severe adverse events were reported. This could also be the\ncase for atezolizumab; the author finally speculates that canine Fc gamma\nreceptors (Fc\u03b3Rs) and neonatal Fc receptors (FcRn) could be compatible between\nhumans and dogs [92]. Table 3 presents the above-discussed studies on the\nclinical and treatment data of canine OMM to specific PD-1/PD-L1 ICIs.\n\n4\\. Conclusions\n\nOverall, the response rate of caninized antibodies in oral melanoma in dogs,\nat least at this stage, is a bit disappointing, with around or less than a 20%\nresponse rate compared to a 40\u201360% response rate in cutaneous melanoma in\npeople. However, it is possible that oral melanoma is not the most promising\ntarget of canine ICI. Evaluating factors such as PD-L1 tumour expression,\ntumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, and molecular/genetic signatures could help\npredict response to ICI in certain types of dog tumours. The selection of the\npatient that benefits the most from potentially expensive ICI must focus on\nfinding markers predictive of the response and potentially screening\nindividual tumours rather than only considering a specific type or class of\ntumours. The improvement of the prediction of response to target therapy would\ncontribute to the development of personalised medicine in dogs.\n\n", "question": "What are the potential benefits of atezolizumab in dogs?", "answer": "Atezolizumab showed blocking activity of the canine PD1/PD-L1 axis and achieved significant functional benefits when used in cPBMC activation in vitro assays, increasing cIFN-\u03b3 production in both samples from healthy and cancer patients."}

Hyperprogression  \n  \nPseudoprogression is a reaction after initiating ICI therapy, with sudden\ntumor enlargement or new lesions seen on PET scans, followed by a decrease in\ntumor size/number on follow-up scans (an example in Figure 8). It is believed\nto be caused by immune cell infiltration and cytokine release. TILs consume\nglucose; therefore, tumor growth and further metabolic activation occur.\nPseudoprogression is seen in up to 10% of metastatic melanoma patients treated\nwith ICIs (15% with ipilimumab) and less frequently in other tumors\n[17,29,111,112,113,114]. It presents as an apparent progression on PET imaging\n(increase in size and/or FDG-avidity of existing lesions or increase in number\nof FDG-avid lesions) without clinical deterioration and followed by a\nresponse. Pseudoprogression usually takes place early during treatment. It is\nimportant to recognize it and not discontinue treatment prematurely before\nachieving clinical benefit. Figure 9 shows various patterns of tumor response\nduring treatment. Adapted from Frelaut et al. [115].\n\nHyperprogressive disease (HPD) is a reaction occurring shortly aft er\ninitiation of ICI therapy, mainly with anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1, and appears as\nsudden rapid tumor growth, typically two-fold or higher, and relates to a\nworse clinical outcome, making it necessary to diagnose it early [29,103,107].\nThe incidence of HPD varies across different cancer types, reaching about\n8\u201330% [108,109]. There is ongoing debate about HPD\u2019s validity; some suggest it\ncould occur independently of therapy [29]. The biological background of HPD is\nstill not well understood. Risk factors are related to tumor biology (e.g.,\nMDM2/MDM4 amplification or cancer type) and advanced age [116,117,118,119].\nProbably, HPD is not dependent on ICI type. Some radiological models\npredicting HPD risk, incorporating FDG PET scans, could potentially enable the\nprediction of HPD, decreasing the risk of delayed treatment adaptation.\nNotable is that HPD is associated with a higher metabolic tumor burden at\nbaseline PET/CT [114,116,120].\n\n8\\.

{"id": "PMC11172575-5", "context": "immunity. In particular, the catabolism of tryptophan exerts an inhibitory\neffect on T cell proliferation and activation [68]. In the BC TME, tryptophan\ncleavage reduces the levels of this amino acid and produces its catabolites,\nwhich collectively contribute to the inhibition of T cell activation [68].\nIndoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation\nof tryptophan to kynurenine. The anti-tumor cytotoxic effects of T cells were\nincreased in a TNBC model after treatment with IDO enzyme inhibitors [69].\nThus, it can be assumed that the metabolism modulation of some amino acids can\ncontribute to improvements in BC immunogenicity.\n\nLipid metabolism, particularly for fatty acids, is central in influencing\nimmune activity or tolerance of immune cells [70]. The reprogramming of fatty\nacid metabolism represents a critical factor for the survival of BC cells [71]\nas well as for tumor immune surveillance [72]. Indeed, it has been\ndemonstrated that obesity can be a predisposing factor for the development and\nprogression of BC and, in particular, it contributes to tumor immune escape by\nreducing both the CD8+ T cell/Treg and M1/M2 macrophage ratios [73]. A\nprolonged obesity status is responsible for a leptin-mediated shift of CD8+ T\ncell metabolism from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation. This process provokes\na decrease in CD8+ T cell effector functions resulting in BC progression [72].\nFurthermore, obesity, through leptin signaling, contributes to the growth and\nmetastasis of BC by supporting immunosenescence but, paradoxically, T cell\nsenescence resulting in an increase in PD-1 expression and dysfunction can\nbetter predispose obese subjects to checkpoint blockade therapy [74]. Hence,\nthe reprogramming of immune TME metabolism exerts a profound effect on anti-\ncancer immunity and on T cell activities. Therefore, therapies affecting\nmetabolic pathways can contribute to reverse immunosuppression and increase\nthe success of immunotherapies aimed at hindering BC progression and\nmetastasis.\n\n1.1.3. CD4+ T Cells\n\nCD4+ T cells represent a heterogeneous cell population constituted mainly by\nTh1, Th2, Th17 and FoxP3+ Treg cells. CD4+ T cells represent a highly\nadaptable and multifunctional component of adaptive T cell immunity, working\nin tandem with their counterpart, the CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Within the\ncomplex network of immune responses, CD4+ T cells undergo differentiation into\nvarious functional subtypes in response to context-dependent signals. In\nparticular, Th1 cells are polarized by IL-12 and IFN\u03b3 and characterized by the\nproduction of IFN\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1; Th2 cells are polarized by IL-4 and secrete\nIL-4, IL-5, and IL-13; Th17 cells are polarized by IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2, and produce\nIL-17; Tregs are induced by TGF-\u03b2 and IL-2 and produce IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 [75].\nThis inherent flexibility enables CD4+ T cells to assume the pivotal role of\ncentral coordinators in orchestrating immune responses. In particular, they\nplay a crucial role in promoting anti-tumor immunity through various\nmechanisms.\n\nTheir primary functions are to provide essential support for CTLs and to\nfacilitate antibody responses.

The extracellular\nmatrix makes up the stroma and contains heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG),\nwhich CAR-T cells must knock down in order to infiltrate the tumor.\nHeparinase, an enzyme that breaks down heparin sulfate proteoglycan, has been\nadded to CAR-T cells, increasing their anticancer activity and tumor invasion.\nSimilarly, in animal models, CAR-T cells that specifically target the\nfibroblast activation protein (FAP) exhibit improved cytotoxic efficacy by\nreducing tumor fibroblasts. However, more research is needed to develop new\ndelivery techniques to extend therapeutic efficacy to complicated solid tumors\n[162].\n\n10.4. Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5.

POMC and POMC derivatives bind to melanocortin\nreceptors (e.g., MC1R, MC2R, belonging to the rhodopsin family of\ntransmembrane receptors) [97].

Introduction\n\nGenetic variation is a crucial factor in the evolution and survival of\nspecies, enabling adaptation to changing environmental conditions and\nproviding resistance to diseases and harmful agents. Among the key aspects of\ngenetic variability, gene polymorphisms and their impact on the risk of the\ndevelopment of diseases have been the subject of intensive research for many\nyears. Gene polymorphism is a naturally occurring phenomenon within genes\ncharacterized by variability in DNA sequences between individuals in a\npopulation of a given species. This means that at a specific gene position,\nthere may be more than one possible nucleotide sequence. Gene polymorphisms\nare usually inherited and constitute a natural part of genetic variability in\nthe population. In contrast to decidedly rarer mutations, genetic polymorphism\nis established when the occurrence of two or more alleles at a given locus in\nthe population reaches a frequency above 1%.\n\nThere are several types of gene polymorphism, with single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) being the most commonly studied. SNPs involve a change in\na single nucleotide of the DNA sequence and include substitutions (replacement\nof one nucleotide with another), insertions (addition of one nucleotide), or\ndeletions (removal of one nucleotide) [1]. Among other types are\nmicrosatellite polymorphisms\u2014Short Tandem Repeat (STR)\u2014and minisatellite\npolymorphisms\u2014Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR)\u2014which result from\ndifferences in the number of shorter or longer DNA sequence repetitions [2].\nPolymorphism may also involve repeated sequences of hundreds or even thousands\nof nucleotides. Changes in the number of repetitions can affect gene\nexpression and be associated with various disease states [3].\n\nVariability in the coding sequence of genes can influence the structure of\nproteins and their functions [4]. Moreover, polymorphism in non-coding regions\nsuch as introns or regulatory regions may affect transcription, translation,\nand gene regulation processes. Understanding various types of genetic\npolymorphisms is crucial in genetics, evolutionary biology, personalized\nmedicine, and research related to the inheritance of diseases. STR and VNTR\nare widely used in forensic genetics for DNA profiling and genetic diagnostics\nto construct genetic maps or determine gene carrier status [3,5,6]. However,\nthe variability of the human genome is primarily attributed to SNPs, which are\nessential in studies related to the inheritance of traits, the predisposition\nto diseases, and personalized medicine. Many SNP polymorphisms occur in genes\nrelated to DNA repair processes, which are crucial for maintaining genome\nintegrity [7,8]. These genes encode proteins that are part of DNA repair\nsystems, i.e., the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, base excision repair\n(BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), DNA mismatch repair (MMR), single-\nstrand break repair (SSBR), and double-strand DNA break repair (DSBR) by\nhomologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) [9].\nPolymorphisms in genes encoding repair proteins can affect their structure,\nfunction, or ability to effectively repair DNA. As a result, individuals\ncarrying specific allele variants may have different DNA repair efficiencies\ncompared to other individuals in the population.

Furthermore, it has been elucidated\nthat each of these subunits has a variety of isoforms, which can combine to\ncreate different versions of NKA, each possessing distinct biochemical and\nbiophysical properties, many of which remain unidentified. Additionally, it\nhas been observed that subunit isoforms and combinations are expressed\ndifferently across various types of tissues with diverse properties. Recent\nyears have witnessed significant progress in comprehending how NKA functions\nas a pump, which is largely attributable to the growing development of\ncrystals that enable the analysis at the atomic level of the interactions\nbetween the amino acids constituting the subunits of NKA and the ions it\ntransports, as well as the ligands that participate in or inhibit its\nfunction.\n\nLikewise, the concept of NKA\u2019s role as a receptor triggering a range of\nsignaling pathways that subsequently affect cellular processes has expanded\nand diversified with new findings.

Introduction\n\nKaempferol (Kam) is a natural flavonoid, which belongs to a group of\ntetrahydroxyflavones, as it has four hydroxy groups positioned at 3, 5, 7 and\n4\u2032 [1]. Kam is found in products of plant origin, mainly leafy vegetables such\nas spinach in the amount of 55 mg/100 g of raw material and broccoli at 7.2\nmg/100 g but also in capers, on average 104.29 mg/100 g [2]. Many studies have\nshown that Kam has various positive features, including antidiabetic,\nantioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, neuroprotective and\ncardioprotective activities. Kam is a flavonoid widely present in many plants,\nincluding medicinal raw materials used in health-supporting therapies. Its\npleiotropic effect, which influences various biological pathways and processes\nin the human body, makes it an interesting subject for scientific research.\nThe structural analysis of kaempferol and its ability to form complex\ncompounds with micro and macro elements naturally occurring in the human body\ncould help elucidate the mechanisms of action of this flavonoid at the\nmolecular level, which is crucial for fully leveraging its therapeutic\npotential. The therapeutic use of Kam is limited by its low solubility, which\nis why many studies focus on modifying the structure of this ligand in order\nto improve bioavailability and biological activity, e.g., by synthesizing\ncomplex compounds with metal ions [3,4,5] or nanoparticles [4,6,7]. The\nattention of recent studies focuses on its potential use in cancer therapy, as\nincreased intake was found to decrease likelihood of many types of cancer like\nstomach, liver, ovary and skin cancer [8]. Its anticancer activity in hormone-\ndependent cancer, observed specifically in estrogen-dependent breast cancer\ncells, seems to be particularly interesting, as Kam can regulate the\nexpression and function of estrogen receptor alpha (Er\u03b1) [9]. In addition, the\nobserved dualistic nature of Kam estrogenic (in low concentrations) and anti-\nestrogenic (in higher concentrations) effects may explain its potential\nbenefits in the prevention of diseases associated with estrogen imbalance\n[10]. Additionally, Kam has been found to inhibit estrogen receptor alpha\nexpression and function in MCF-7 cells, leading to a dose-dependent decrease\nin cell number and a concomitant decrease in ER-alpha protein levels, further\nsupporting its antiproliferative effects [11].\n\nAnother mechanism that determines the cytotoxic nature of this compound\nagainst breast cancer cells may be the inhibition of glucose uptake, which\nsupports a high rate of glycolysis and uncontrolled proliferation [12].

First, there should be an event or a damage to\nthe patient; second, there should be an action that caused the damage; and\nlast, there should be an evaluation of the causal link between the error on\nthe part of the physician and the event (damage) involving the patient [37].\n\nThe reconstruction of the actual sequence of events that occurred is part of\nevaluating a professional liability case, and to do so extensively, it is\nnecessary to analyze the collection of informed consent from the patient, as\nthere cannot be a medical pathway without consent from the patient.\n\nDespite the existing variations in civil and tort law across countries, there\nseems to be a consensus on the assessment of medical malpractice and\ncompensation for damages. The liability when using sensor and AI tools in\nhealthcare can be analyzed through four approaches: the contract-based\napproach, the approach based on breach of duty to inform, the fault-based\napproach, and the approach related to the good itself (Figure 5).\n\n4.2.1. The Contract-Based Approach\n\nA. Context\n\nContractual medical liability was intended to compensate for damage resulting\nfrom the improper performance of a care contract by a healthcare professional.\nIn France, the Mercier decision of the Cour de cassation (Court of Cassation)\nconsidered that \u201ca real contract was formed between the doctor and the\npatient, including several commitments for the practitioner\u201d [38]. In addition\nto the commitment to use all possible means to cure the patient, it was\nexpected that the physician would provide conscientious and attentive care in\naccordance with the data acquired from science. The doctor was then considered\nto be the debtor of an obligation of means.

For example, an R0 rate of 84.8% was found in 100\nunresectable GC patients who underwent conversion therapy30.

Note that this is a reasonable\nassumption since SCNAs do not generally affect every genomic region, and the\nremaining genomic regions are affected by zero or more WGDs. As such, we\nidentify allelic-balanced genomic regions as genomic bins in which the\nhypothesis of allelic balance (allele frequency equal to 0.5) cannot be\nexcluded for >20% of the putative SNPs in such bin (a threshold of 20% has\nbeen chosen to account for the presence of somatic variants and homozygous\nSNPs with sequencing errors).

We thus use the read-depth ratios\nfor all the genomic bins in allelic-balanced segments to empirically estimate\nthe distribution of read-depth ratios for these regions. Since multiple copy-\nnumber states can underly allelic-balanced genomic region, we use a Gaussian\nmodel for read-depth ratios as in previous studies, and we separate the\ndistributions of different copy-number states using a Gaussian use a Gaussian\nmixture model (edivisive method of mclust algorithm, v5.4.5).

It is regarded\nas a major worldwide burden. A 2020 report shows about 19.3 million additional\nincidences of cancer worldwide, along with approximately 10.0 million\ncancer\u2010related deaths [1]. Although cancer registries fluctuate based on the\ncountry's growth level, the incidence and mortality of cancer are declining in\ndeveloped nations like the United States and Europe. On the other hand, the\nless developed and poorer nations are experiencing a rise in the prevalence of\ncancer [2]. In Lebanon, citizens face cancer as a challenge on the additional\nportion of the country's ongoing political and economic issues. Lebanon has\nthe highest cancer incidence rate among Arab nations [3].\n\nCancer and its therapy are a significant source of stress, which makes it\ndifficult for patients to adjust to the disease and causes emotions like worry\nor depression [4]. Available treatment approaches cause the body to change\nsignificantly and undergo severe changes, such as disfigurement, scarring,\nskin changes and loss of a bodily part, which can cause general body image\nproblems [5]. Body image distress is a serious psychological condition that is\ncaused by a noticeable deviation from one's ideal look and a functional\nimpairment in it [6]. Studies have shown that self\u2010perception influences\ndecision\u2010making. It provides a point of reference for values and motivations\nto guide important decisions and improves the evaluation of options by raising\nthe decision\u2010maker's awareness of one's reactions [7]. Thus, oncology patient\ndistress can directly affect the clinical outcomes and quality of care [1].\nThis has urged healthcare system designers and authorities to create means to\nmaximize disease self\u2010management practices to achieve better clinical outcomes\nand fewer complications [8]. One way to mitigate distress complications and\nenhance the clinical self\u2010management of cancer patients is to reinforce proper\npatient education. It has been said that chemotherapy adherence is a\nmultifaceted and ever\u2010changing process that necessitates constant observation,\ninstruction and tailored follow\u2010up. Research indicates that providing\npersonalized education and ongoing support to cancer patients improves their\nself\u2010efficacy [9]. Cumulative engagement policies will enhance shared\ndecision\u2010making between the clinician and the patient. As a consequence,\nincreased patient participation in decision\u2010making aligns with the\noptimization of the healthcare services value [10, 11].\n\nThe healthcare system design has witnessed multiphase evolutions over time\n\n", "question": "What is the impact of cancer and its therapy on patients' mental health?", "answer": "Cancer and its therapy are a significant source of stress for patients, causing emotions like worry or depression, and can lead to body image distress, a serious psychological condition that can affect clinical outcomes and quality of care."}

In this way, the linkage\nof organoid function to a particular disease phenotype may offer possibilities\nthat would otherwise not be possible or unethical, such as the susceptibility\nto bacterial infection in intestinal organoids, or to respiratory virus\ninfections using lung organoids. Making use of the well-described intestinal\norganoids, researchers have explored applications in autoimmune disease\ncontexts, such as inflammatory bowel diseases. In an ongoing clinical trial\n(NCT02874365), researchers plan to morphologically characterize organoids\nderived from Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis patients, as well as\nhealthy controls. By measuring gene expression and protein levels of relevant\nmolecular pathways (Wnt/APC/beta-catenin), genes of tumor initiation (PTEN,\nBMPR1A, p53 and KRAS), and inflammatory parameters (cytokines and lipid\nmediators), the group aims to further understand intestinal renewal.

CT can be obtained easily and nearly universally,\noften providing the first insight into an individual\u2019s disease process. PET\ncan enhance the imaforation obtained by CT by providing functional information\nbased on the tracer administered. Where both of these techniques fail in soft\ntissue discrimination which may be an important characteristics in the\ndiagnosis of cancer and fibrotic diseases, MRI is excellent in providing this\ninformation. Ultrasound is more easily obtained, and while resolution may be\ndecreased compared to other modalities, the benefit of repeated monitoring and\nthe used of advanced ultrasonographic techniques may provide enhanced\ninformation based on tissue characteristics, leading clinicians toward one\ndiagnosis versus another. Finally, the application of radiomic and artificial\nintelligence techniques to each of these has the potential to extract more\ninformation from the images obtained and therefore provide better diagnostic\nclarity. In contrary to being in opposition, these multiple techniques\nrepresent a complimentary set of tools to move toward early and accurate\ndiagnosis of diseases characterized by fibrogenesis.\n\nIn order to best diagnose diseases with fibrotic pathophysiology, these\ntechniques have been employed and continue to advance the field. Here, we have\nreviewed them and how techniques originally developed for each can advance the\ndiagnosis of the other. These advanced methods can improve the screening\nprocess, enable early diagnosis, increase accuracy and rate of diagnosis, have\nbetter staging performance, predict tumor progression and metastasis, forecast\nmortality and survival rates in fibrosis and cancer, may provide a better\nmeans for both therapy and treatment-response monitoring, and reduce\ncomplications.

These features are obtained by\npassing images through a feature extractor network that has been pre-trained\non either domain-specific or non-specific images. CTransPath is a domain-\nspecific model that has been trained on unlabeled H&E-stained slides from The\nCancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).12 For limited datasets such as those obtainable in\nrare diseases, using domain-specific features to train an aMIL can offer\nsignificant performance advantages over non-specific models such as\nImageNet.15,16\n\nIn this study, we leveraged the largest reported study cohort of digitized NTs\nanalyzed with these state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

It should be noted that the\neffectiveness of epigenetic therapies in AML is context dependent. AML cells\nharboring somatic mutations in DNMT3A appear more susceptible to azacytidine\ntreatment (150). Conversely, AML cells expressing high levels of ubiquitin\nligase RNF5 show less sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors (151). Given that\nepigenetic changes in AML cells can modulate cell-intrinsic immune response\n(152), it is reasonable to develop epigenetic immunotherapies by combining\nepigenetic drugs with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies (153).\nIndeed, preclinical studies showed that treatment with azacytidine increases\nCD123 expression, resulting in enhanced recognition and elimination of AML\ncells in response to anti-CD123 CAR T cells (153). Together, these findings\nhighlight that epigenetic immunotherapies may hold great promise for\nhematologic malignancy treatment.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nImmunotherapy, including ICI, has revolutionized current oncology treatment\n(1, 16, 154). However, a plethora of clinical trials have shown that many\npatients with cancer ultimately develop resistance to ICIs (155\u2013157). The TME\nis now recognized as a critical barrier impairing the efficacy of ICI (5, 158,\n159). Given the heterogeneity of the TME across cancer types, specifically\ntargeting this context-dependent interplay between the TME and cancer cells is\na recognized strategy for sensitizing nonresponder tumors to ICIs (11, 26, 27,\n160). In addition to genetic alterations, epigenetic remodeling plays an\nimportant role in regulating TME heterogeneity (36, 161, 162). Because cancer\ncells have a more plastic and unstable epigenome than nonmalignant cells, they\ncan easily adapt to the selection pressures and exhibit a distinct epigenetic\nstate that can further allow them to activate alternative gene regulatory\nprograms (12, 35, 163, 164), including genes for controlling T cell immunity\n(Figure 1) (51, 138). This theory may explain the significant correlation\nbetween epigenetic alterations in cancer cells and T cell dysfunction (79,\n165). Additionally, cancer cells that have undergone epigenome alteration\nrelease various cytokines and chemokines within the TME, recruiting and\nactivating tumor-associated myeloid cells (e.g., macrophages, MDSCs, and\nneutrophils).

As\noutlined above, intratumoral fluorescence of Ac2-800CW was lower than\nEc4.1-800CW fluorescence.\n\nDiscussion\n\nFluorescence-guided surgery can play a key role in improving radical resection\nrates by assisting surgeons with intraoperative visualization of malignant\ntissue. The quest for adequate tumor-targeting moieties for FGS tracers has\nshifted from antibodies towards strategically designed targeting molecules\nwith optimal pharmacokinetics for in vivo imaging, such as DARPins. Using\nreal-time NIRF imaging and PA imaging, we showed that EpCAM-binding DARPins\nAc2-800CW and Ec4.1-800CW provided high-contrast tumor delineation in a\nclinically relevant in vivo model at 24 h post-injection, accompanied by low\nsignals in healthy surrounding organs. This study thereby provides the first\npreclinical substantiation that EpCAM-binding DARPins are promising targeting\nmolecules for NIRF and PA imaging of cancer. Considering the strong abundance\nof EpCAM in a wide variety of epithelial cancer types, EpCAM-targeted DARPin-\nbased NIRF/PA imaging tracers may be deployed in a broad, pan-carcinoma\nclinical context.\n\nIntraoperatively, combining NIRF with PA imaging provides a powerful\ndiagnostic and screening tool, allowing detection of malignant tissue located\nbeyond NIRF imaging\u2019s penetration capability using a single-contrast agent\ninjection. Once a lesion is identified and approached guided by PA imaging,\nNIRF imaging allows tumor identification and removal with higher accuracy by\noverlaying the actual surgeon\u2019s view with real-time fluorescence. The synergy\nbetween PA and NIRF imaging thus provides an improved intraoperative tumor\nimaging approach, where the strengths of each modality complement and\ncompensate for their individual limitations. Several studies have successfully\ndescribed the use of 800CW-based contrast agents for bimodal NIRF/PA imaging\n[33, 34]. Intraoperatively, Tummers et al. demonstrated a 3.7-fold higher mean\nPA signal in primary pancreatic cancer lesions compared to normal pancreatic\ntissue using the anti-EGFR tracer cetuximab-800CW, providing the first\nclinical evidence of the combined NIRF/PA imaging approach. Despite these\npromising findings, routine implementation is hampered by, among others, the\nclinical availability of PA imaging systems [35]. In contrast to NIRF/PA\nimaging, research into DARPins as tumor imaging agents has primarily focused\non nuclear imaging, which has already yielded multiple encouraging results\n[28, 36\u201340]. Recently, a first-in-human study evaluating the anti-HER2 DARPin\ntracer 99mTc-(HE)3-G3 for SPECT imaging of breast cancer reported a favorable\nsafety and tolerability profile, and it showed clear visualization of both\nprimary and metastatic HER2-positive lesions (NCT04277338) [41].\nInterestingly, clinically defined HER2-negative tumors could also be\nvisualized, albeit with lower contrast.

Mechanistically, TK fusions\nare often formed by genomic rearrangements between two DNA double-strand\nbreaks (DSBs) in introns, leading to the transcription of in-frame chimeric\ngene products. However, the mechanisms by which these recurrent breakpoints\nare selected among the large pool of potential fusion combinations remain\nunclear14. For example, in patients with NSCLC, EML4 is the most frequent\npartner gene of ALK fusions and CD74 for ROS1 fusions. However, EML4-ROS1 or\nCD74-ALK fusions have not been reported, although these fusions can\ntheoretically be functional. Furthermore, multiple introns in ALK can\npotentially create in-frame ALK fusions fully preserving the kinase domain,\nbut most ALK fusions involve breaks in intron 19, regardless of its partner\ngenes15,16. The molecular basis of selecting partner genes, introns, and the\nclinical implications of different fusion types between the typical and\natypical fusions remain unclear.\n\nIn this study, we identify mutually exclusive fusion partner selection and\nspecific exon usage in TK fusions based on the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations\nin Cancer (COSMIC) datasets.

With a deepening understanding of BC treatment, a new era of\ncomprehensive treatment has emerged (2). Pharmacological therapy is an\nindispensable component of the comprehensive treatment approach for BC\npatients, but it brings about a series of challenges (3). Firstly, the\nexisting medications come with significant side effects (i.e.,\ngastrointestinal reactions, bone marrow suppression, and myocardial structural\ndamage). Secondly, many patients show no response to pharmacological treatment\n(i.e., treatment-resistant). As such, novel and effective drug therapy targets\nfor BC are still needed.\n\nProteins play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of diseases,\nwith circulating proteins often serving as viable targets for pharmacological\ninterventions due to their amenability to direct manipulation. In preceding\nresearch, several circulating proteins linked to BC have been documented,\nincluding cellular communication network factor 1 (CCN1) (4), serum secreted\nclusterin (sCLU) (5), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) (6). However,\nmost of these studies are observational and yield results that are susceptible\nto the possibility of confounding or reverse causation bias.\n\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) serve as the gold standard for\nestablishing the relationship between drugs (protein targets) and BC. However,\nthe implementation of RCTs is challenged by significant financial and time\ncosts. Mendelian Randomization (MR) is an epidemiological approach that\nemploys genetic variation as a proxy for exposure to predict causal\nrelationships with outcomes (7, 8). Owing to the random allocation of genetic\nvariations during conception, MR is largely impervious to the influence of\nconfounders and reverse causality.

The cell cycle patterns of all the clusters were further\nanalysed, and most of the cells were in the G0/G1 phase (Supplementary Fig.\n2b, c). However, the cell cycle patterns of C16 and C18 were different from\nthose of the other clusters, with a higher proportion of G2/M and S phase\ncells (Supplementary Fig. 2d, e).\n\nIn addition to tumour-related signalling pathways, immune-related signalling\npathways were also upregulated in the TCC group, including the cytokine DNA\nsensing pathway, intestinal immune network for IgA production, NOD-like\nreceptor signalling pathway, TGF-beta signalling pathway, and natural killer\ncell-mediated cytotoxicity (Fig. 2g). The top two enriched signatures,\nintestinal immune network for IgA production and cytokine\u2012cytokine receptor\ninteraction, were also immune-related signatures (Fig. 2h).\n\nIn the tumours resected from the PDX models, in addition to human-derived\ncells, we also obtained some murine-derived cells, which were represented by\nnine cell clusters (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). These identified cell clusters\nwere assigned to known cell lineages based on marker genes: we identified\nmajor clusters of fibroblasts and macrophages as well as clusters of innate\nlymphoid cells (ILCs), endothelial cells, stromal cells and monocytes\n(Supplementary Fig. 3c, d). Moreover, all of these identified murine-derived\ncells were mainly in the G0/G1 phase (Supplementary Fig. 3e\u2013g). Although the\nimmune function of nude mice was deficient, we tentatively concluded that TCC\nactivated the immune response to tumours in nude mice.\n\nOverall, the cell clusters identified by scRNA-seq showed pleiotropic changes\nin response to single-agent and combination therapy, indicating that TCC might\nactivate the immune response to tumours.\n\nThe C16+C18 cluster was the TCC-targeted cell cluster\n\nTo further determine the role of TCC in the immune response towards tumours in\nhumans, we compared the DMSO group with the single-agent and combined-agent\ngroups separately (Fig. 3a\u2013h, Supplementary Fig. 4). Two clusters, C2 and\nC16+C18, were found to be sensitive to the combined therapy, showing a gradual\ndecrease in the number of cells in the DMSO, TC and TCC groups (Fig. 3b).

According to the above results, we found that only the C16+C18\ncluster was the main target cell cluster of TCC; that is, this cluster was\nsensitive to combined therapy but had no significant response to the three\nmonotherapies. This finding was consistent with the tumour regression\nphenomenon observed in our PDX models (Fig. 1g\u2013i).

The pathophysiological mechanism of the\nassociation between sarcopenia and poorer outcomes in cancer patients has\nremained relatively uncertain. Recent findings suggest five possible\nmechanisms: the role of skeletal muscle mass to modulate inflammation through\nthe immune system via cytokines and myokines, the influence on insulin-\ndependent glucose control, mitochondrial function, synthetic and degradative\nprotein pathways, and pharmacokinetics of anticancer drugs22. In metastatic\nand non-metastatic breast cancer, the occurrence of sarcopenia is associated\nwith an increased risk of death and reduced OS in patients23,24. The\ncorrelation between sarcopenia and survival has also been demonstrated in\nhepatocellular, pancreatic, ovarian, gastric, and oesophageal cancers25\u201329.\n\nMalignancy can result in a hypercatabolic state brought on by systemic\ninflammation and other tumor-related variables, which accelerate the\nprogression of skeletal muscle wasting and sarcopenia30. The presence of\nsarcopenia indicates that patients have limited reserves to deal with surgical\nstress and are more prone to complications31, and higher mortality32. Several\nstudies have shown that L3-SMI correlates well with patients' whole-body\nskeletal muscle mass and has become an objective and valid evaluation index of\npatients' whole-body muscle mass33. In clinical practice, it is more common to\nuse the third lumbar skeletal muscle index (L3-SMI) to determine muscle mass.\nThe L3-SMI is calculated by obtaining a cross-section at the L3 level by\ncomputed tomography (CT) and then measuring the skeletal muscle area (SMA) by\nthe threshold method and dividing by the square of height34. Recent research\nhas demonstrated that cephalocervical skeletal muscles such as TMT can also be\nused to detect muscle mass decrease in addition to lumbar skeletal muscles35.\nMoreover, according to the consensus of the American Society for Parenteral\nand Enteral Nutrition, temporal muscle atrophy is one of the physical\nmanifestations of muscle atrophy in malnutrition and can be used in the\nnutritional assessment of patients which further substantiates the viability\nof employing TMT as an assessment tool for evaluating total body muscle\nmass36.\n\nTemporal muscle thickness has been shown to be a suitable surrogate marker of\nskeletal muscle mass and can be used as a potential basis for determining\nsarcopenia10,11.

Based on this, a\nstudy developed a rapamycin-induced, caspase9-based suicide switch (iRC9). As\ndiscussed above, the rapamycin can bind with FKBP12 and FRB to form a\ntripartite complex.

Ganciclovir (GCV) is a\nnucleoside analog that can be phosphorylated by the HSV-TK into the GCV-\nmonophosphate (MP) form, which is then further transformed into GCV-\ntriphosphate (TP) by host kinases. The GCV-TP incorporates into the nascent\nDNA chain during gene replication and interferes with the replication process,\nleading to CAR-T apoptosis (Fig. 6B) 119. However, this suicide switch is\nsignificantly limited by immunogenicity. Multiple immunogenic epitopes were\nidentified in T cells expressing HSV-TK, leading to CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T\ncell-mediated anti-CAR-T responses 96. Another synthetic suicide switch was\ndescribed as a truncated form of epidermal growth factor receptor (tEGFR)\nexpressed on the surface of CAR-T cells. The tEGFR can be recognized by the\nmonoclonal antibody cetuximab, which binds to tEGFR and recruits effector\ncells to kill the CAR-T cells (Fig. 6C) 114. This approach has successfully\nprevented CAR-T-mediated depletion of normal B cells in xenograft mice models,\nmeanwhile without tumor relapse. Therefore, this suicide switch is promising\nfor controlling persisting CAR-T cytotoxicity-related side effects in clinical\npatients.\n\nDifferent switches discussed in this section should be applied to different\nconditions.

A\nmeta-analysis of cryotherapy for the prevention of TIPN in taxane patients\n(32) incorporated nine experiments utilizing cryotherapy techniques, such as\nfrozen gloves and socks, whole-limb cryocompression, continuous-flow cooling,\nand regional cooling. Utilizing CTCAE as the primary outcome measure, the\nfindings suggest an uncertain efficacy of cryotherapy in preventing CIPN.\nSimilarly, a systematic review of 11 trials evaluating cryotherapy\u2019s efficacy\nand safety for CIPN (33) revealed mixed results. Roughly half of the studies\ndemonstrated significant improvement in at least one endpoint related to\npreventing CIPN. A multicenter randomized controlled trial (34) was conducted,\ninvolving patients with various types of cancer. The experimental group used\nice gloves, while no significant improvement was observed in the chemotherapy-\ninduced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) subscale reported by patients. These\nfindings are consistent with the results summarized in this study, indicating\nthat ice gloves do not have a significant preventive effect on CIPN.\n\nThe pathological and physiological mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced\nperipheral neuropathy (CIPN) are currently unclear. Potential targets of\nplatinum agents and taxane analogs include microtubules in the dorsal root\nganglia, axonal components, ion channels, and the mitochondria of peripheral\nnerve fibers. These targets are believed to be involved in the development of\nnerve damage and related neuropathic symptoms in CIPN. However, further\nresearch is still needed to fully understand the complex mechanisms of CIPN\n(4). Some researchers believe that chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy\n(CIPN) is dose-dependent and exhibits a length-dependent distribution, meaning\nthat higher doses of chemotherapy drugs are more likely to cause nerve damage,\nwith the nerves furthest from the spinal cord being the most affected. This\nhypothesis suggests that reduced delivery of chemotherapy drugs to the\nperipheral nerves may have a neuroprotective effect and potentially reduce\nnerve damage (34). For example, one animal study showed that cryotherapy\nprevents TIPN through local vasoconstriction, thereby reducing the delivery of\nneurotoxic chemotherapy drugs to peripheral nerves (35). Another in vivo study\nshowed that local hypothermia reduced sciatic nerve blood flow and\nneurometabolism in rats (36), this suggests a reduction in the cumulative\ntoxic chemotherapy dose near the distal nerve fibers, ultimately highlighting\nthe role of ice gloves in the fight against CIPN. In the above example,\ncryotherapy is mainly used for the patient\u2019s hands and/or feet. When the\nepidermal temperature drops to about 20\u00b0C, blood flow is reported to decrease\nby about 50% (37), A local temperature that is too low may reduce the drug\ndistribution at the corresponding location. From a mechanical perspective,\ncryotherapy can reduce the distribution of taxanes on the hands and feet,\nfurther reducing the aggregation and binding of microtubules, inhibiting\nchanges in cell shape and cell stability, and impairing axonal transport of\nessential cellular components, ultimately preventing the degeneration of\ndistal nerve segments and axonal membrane remodeling (2).

These factors\nsuggest that GPER-based antidepressants may be more acceptable to clinical\npatients. However, this does not imply that ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 are poor targets.\nAlthough the majority of classical estrogen receptors (ERs) are expressed in\nthe nucleus, a small number of these classical ER subtypes are expressed on\nthe cell membrane. Moreover, the activation of classical ERs can regulate gene\nexpression more briefly and rapidly. Therefore, further analysis of the\ndifferences in the expression of various ERs in key brain regions associated\nwith depression and the affinity preferences of estrogen alternative\ntherapeutic drugs for these ERs will help determine the most appropriate ER\ntarget for developing antidepressant therapies. In any case, therapeutic drugs\ntargeting key molecules such as inflammatory cytokines within the estrogen-\nimmune modulatory signaling pathway should play an effective role in treating\nmenopausal depression.\n\nNeurological impairments caused by immune imbalance\n\nAs discussed above, due to decreased estrogen levels, menopausal depression is\ncharacterized by an immune imbalance that includes abnormal activity of immune\nfactors such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IL-33, and IFN-\u03b3. In this\nsection, we will further focus on neurological impairments caused by immune\nimbalance and the detailed pathogenesis of these impairments, providing a\ncomprehensive overview of this complex phenomenon based on the findings of\nmenopausal depression and its related fields.\n\nBBB destruction\n\nThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) refers to the isolating material between brain\ncells or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma and is mainly composed of\ncapillary endothelial cells with tight junctions, the endothelial basement\nmembrane and the astrocyte foot plate. Under normal conditions, the BBB\ncontrols the selective permeability between the components of the plasma and\nbrain tissue and plays a protective role in brain tissue. Under aging or\npathological conditions, the integrity of the BBB structure changes, and\nperipheral substances enter brain tissue, leading to dysfunction of brain\ncells or CSF.\n\nStudies on changes in BBB structure after a decrease in estrogen levels have\nshown that the expression of the tight junction protein claudin-5 decreases\nduring menopause and that the permeability of paracellular junctions to\nsucrose increases, thereby increasing the probability of brain edema and\nstroke [62, 63]. In the brain tissue of menopausal women or animal models, a\ndecrease in estrogen levels caused an increase in the number of M1 microglia\nand activated astrocytes, which can secrete a large number of inflammatory\ncytokines. Therefore, inflammatory cytokines may play an important role in\nchanges in BBB permeability [25, 64\u201374]. Several subsequent studies have\ndemonstrated that TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-17 can reduce the expression of\nclaudin-5, zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and other tight junction proteins by\nactivating NF-\u03baB signaling pathways in endothelial cells, destroying the\nstructure of the BBB and promoting depressive behavior [69, 70].

Adaptive immunity\nin tumor immune responses primarily involves T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes.\nResearch indicates that RNA methylation plays a pivotal role in the\ndevelopment, differentiation, activation, exhaustion processes, and\ntherapeutic responses of these immune cells by modulating the translation and\nexpression of RNA and proteins [242]. Below, we delve into the specific\nregulatory mechanisms of RNA methylation in adaptive immunity and immune\ncells.\n\nT lymphocytes\n\nT lymphocytes, critical components of adaptive immunity, originate from bone\nmarrow progenitors and undergo maturation in the thymus, where they play\npivotal roles. Na\u00efve T cells possess the ability to differentiate into various\nsubsets, such as T helper (Th) cells, depending on their stem cell features\n[243]. During thymic development, T cell precursors undergo positive or\nnegative selection, leading to differentiation into CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in\nthe thymic cortex and regulatory T (Treg) cells in the thymic medulla [244].\nNumerous studies have highlighted the role of RNA methylation in mediating\nvarious functions of T cells, including proliferation, activation, and\napoptosis, through the involvement of multiple RNA methylation regulators\n[245, 246] (Fig. 4).\n\nCD4+T cells\n\nResearchers have demonstrated that inhibiting METTL3 facilitates the\nactivation of CD4+ T cells while suppressing the differentiation of effector T\ncells, particularly Treg cells, by reducing the expression of Foxp3 in a\nm6A-dependent manner [247]. Inhibition of METTL3 reduces m6A methylation\nlevels, promotes cell apoptosis, hinders effector T cell differentiation, and\ninhibits allogeneic CD4+ T cell responses [24]. In na\u00efve T cells deficient in\nMETTL3, the activity of the SOCs family is enhanced, which encodes STAT\ninhibitory proteins, thus suppressing STAT activation and impeding the\nproliferation and differentiation of T cells [248]. Similarly, WTAP and METTL3\nexhibit similar characteristics in regulating mRNA stability. CD4+ T cells\ndeficient in WTAP undergo apoptosis and exhibit reduced proliferation upon TCR\nsignal activation [249]. The presence of m6A methylase is essential for T\ncells to exert immune functions. Additionally, the m6A demethylase ALKBH5\nenhances the stability of CXCL2 and IFN-\u03b3 mRNA and proteins by reducing m6A\nmodification expression, thereby preserving CD4+ T cell immune function [250]\n(Fig. 4).\n\nDuring HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells, m6A levels are upregulated,\npotentially mediated by variations in the activity of m6A writers or erasers\nin T-cells [251, 252]. Overexpression of YTHDF3 has been shown to decrease the\nproduction and infection of HIV-1 by incorporating into viral particles [253,\n254].

This is especially true for breast and prostate cancers in\nwhich 92% and 96% of women and men, respectively, are expected to live at\nleast 5 years following a diagnosis in Australia [1]. As a result, it is\nbecoming increasingly important to consider how to best manage both short and\nlong-term adverse effects of cancer treatment. For certain common cancer\ntherapies, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and radiotherapy for\ncertain cancer types, long-term treatment-related adverse effects can include\naccelerated musculoskeletal decline and/or increased cardiovascular disease\nrisk [3, 4].\n\nRegular exercise and a healthy diet are commonly recommended for cancer\nsurvivors, reflecting the wealth of evidence demonstrating wide-ranging\nbenefits for many physical and psychosocial treatment-related adverse effects\n[5, 6]. Strong evidence indicates that exercise with or without dietary\ninterventions can ameliorate long term adverse effects into cancer\nsurvivorship [5, 6], as well as reducing cancer-specific and all-cause\nmortality [7]. Healthy dietary patterns that consistently represent high\nintakes of fruits and vegetables with low processed foods and meats, have\nshown reduced cancer-specific mortality [6], particularly for breast cancer\n[8\u201310].

Cancer survivors in England participating in\na focus group study reported receiving little to no advice on exercise or\nphysical activity from healthcare professionals [15]. Similarly, a recent\nscoping review showed that Australian cancer survivors commonly reported\nlimited or ineffective dietary information from healthcare providers following\ntreatment, and that the role of diet in recovery from treatment was not often\nexplained [14]. This is consequential as cancer survivors are more likely to\nmake positive exercise and dietary changes if their oncology providers discuss\nthese areas during their visits [16]. Furthermore, several health care related\nbarriers to engaging in both exercise and nutrition services that have been\nreported, including the cost, availability, and access to cancer-specific\nservices, lead many survivors to make lifestyle changes without allied health\nsupport [17, 18].

Upon engagement\nwith MHC1, KIR receptors transmit inhibitory signals to the cytolytic\nmachinery of NK cells, thereby preventing the lysis of target cells (72). The\ninhibitory signal is mediated, in part, by the binding of the Src homology\ndomain-containing tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-1) to ITIMs within the cytoplasmic\ndomains of KIRs (73). This interaction leads to the dephosphorylation of\nsignaling molecules that are crucial for the activation of NK cell cytolytic\nfunctions and release of inflammatory cytokines ( Figure 2A ).\n\n3.3MHC1\u2013LILRB1 signaling in DC cells\n\nDendritic cells (DCs) are the most effective antigen presentation cells in the\nimmune system, bridging the activation of innate and adaptive immunity (74).\nThey are capable of sensing imbalances in the body, secreting cytokines and\ngrowth factors, and processing antigens for presentation to T helper (Th)\ncells, thereby inducing initial T cell activation and differentiation into\neffector cells (75). The precursor of DCs are monocytes or CD34+ progenitor\ncells which are highly expressed LILRB1. In differentiated DCs, the expression\nof LILRB1 is slightly upregulated and present in nearly all lineages upon\nmaturation (13, 76). Additionally, stimulation with toll-like receptor (TLR)\nagonists such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or imiquimod has been demonstrated\nto further upregulate LILRB1 level in some subset of DCs, suggesting the\ndynamic expression of LILRB1 under various circumstances (13).\n\nDCs have been implicated in the induction of immune tolerance through their\ninteraction with MHC1-LILRB1. This interaction transmits inhibitory signals\nthat contribute to the suppression of immune responses, thereby preventing\nexcessive activation and promoting tolerance. For instance, in the presence of\na LILRB1 ligand, DCs cannot be fully activated by LPS and are unable to\nsecrete inflammatory cytokines (13, 28, 77). Moreover, the ligation of LILRB1\nwith MHC1 also compromises the immune-stimulating effect of the osteoclast-\nassociated receptor which is an activating FcR \u03b3- chain associated myeloid\nreceptor involved in antigen presentation (78).

This can be primarily\nattributed to the integrity of surgical resection, histological response to\ntreatment, and metastasis and recurrence. Among them, metastasis is the most\nessential factor contributing to an overall poor survival rate; the five-year\nsurvival rate of OS patients with metastasis is <30% 7-9.

However, early microscopic lesions are\nchallenging to detect using conventional imaging methods, necessitating the\nidentification of relevant biological markers for the diagnosis of OS, as well\nas to predict distant metastasis tendency and assess treatment response 11.\n\nT-box transcription factor 3 (TBX3), belonging to the T-box transcription\nfactor protein family, plays a key role in regulating biological development.\nPrevious studies have indicated that Tbx2, as a member of the T-box\ntranscription factor protein family, might be involved in the regulation of\ncell cycle and cell adhesion. Moreover, Tbx2 has been reported to negatively\ncontrol Cx43 gene expression, playing a role in regulating osteoblast-like\ncells and embryo development in rat osteosarcoma cells 12, 13. The structural\nelements of TBX3 include a DNA-binding T domain, two inhibitory domains, and\none activation domain that can function as either inhibitors or agonists of\ndownstream proteins 14. TBX3 has the capability to enhance the activity of\nphosphoinositide 3-kinase by inhibiting phosphatase and tensin homolog,\nleading to aberrant cell growth. In addition, TBX3 functions in inhibiting\ncellular senescence and anti-apoptosis, substantially contributing to aberrant\ntransforming growth factor-\u03b2 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathways 15-19. A\ndirect association reportedly exists between TBX3 expression imbalance and\nmalignant tumor onset and progression. For example, in hepatocellular\ncarcinoma and colorectal cancer, TBX3 expression levels are positively\ncorrelated with the grading of cell proliferation markers (Ki-67); further,\nits high expression is closely related to malignant staging, tumor size, and\npoor prognosis 20-22.

Positioned within the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM),\nOPA1 plays a crucial role in preserving mitochondrial fusion and cellular\nwell-being 23. By modulating the delicate equilibrium between mitochondrial\nfission and fusion, OPA1 regulates mitochondrial dynamics.\n\nStudies have indicated that OPA1 is overexpressed or mutated across various\ncancers and is closely associated with protein phosphorylation, patient\nprognosis, and immune cell infiltration 24. Additionally, research has shown\nconcurrent amplification of OPA1 and MFN1 copy numbers, synergistically\nactivated in tumor epithelial cells in lung cancer tissues. Both OPA1 and MFN1\nexhibit high expression levels in LUAD tumor tissues, with elevated OPA1\nexpression correlating with poor prognosis.

While \u201caging\u201d is\nthought to favor neutrophil clearance (18), other studies reported a role for\n\u201caged\u201d neutrophils in the first line of defense in acute inflammation (21).\nNeutrophils returning into the bone marrow can temporarily be engulfed by\nmegakaryocytes without phagocytosis (termed emperipolesis), transfer membrane\nfragments to newly produced platelets, and thus modulate thrombopoiesis (22).\nThe fate of neutrophils that underwent emperipolesis remains to be\ninvestigated.\n\nThe hematopoietic system rapidly adapts to a higher demand for neutrophils\nduring severe acute infections by switching from steady state to emergency\ngranulopoiesis, critical for host survival (23, 24). Pathogen sensing by\nnonhematopoietic and hematopoietic progenitor cells initiates de novo\nproduction of neutrophils through the release of G-CSF, chemokine C-X-C motif\nligand 12 (CXCL12), and chemokine CC motif ligand 3 (CCL3) in the bone marrow\n(and extramedullary sites) and mobilization of mature neutrophils from the\nintravascular (marginated) pools (23, 24).

This, alongside the successful demonstration of good local\ntumor control using local therapies, has paved the way to treatment de-\nescalation, favoring less invasive and nonsurgical resection techniques [1\u20134].\nMinimally invasive nonsurgical techniques aim for curative outcomes while also\nacknowledging the importance of preserving or enhancing the quality of life\n(QoL) and the cosmetic appearance following the procedure. The most studied\nand widely used nonsurgical ablative techniques for the treatment of breast\ncancer include cryoablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound surgery (HIFU),\nradiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), and laser ablation\n(LA) [5, 6].\n\nWhile breast cancer incidence and mortality are on the decline in many\ncountries, Japan is experiencing an upward trend [7, 8], necessitating more\nfrequent screening and mammography. Combined with improvements in breast\ncancer imaging and associated with the detection of even microscopic breast\ncancers that are non-palpable, the demand for nonsurgical treatment is\nexpected to increase. In contrast to United States, where data show a trend\ntoward older age incidence [9], in Japan, breast cancer incidence peaks in the\nlate 40s and early 60s [10\u201312]. Women in this age group often occupy important\nsocietal and family positions. Consequently, there is a growing demand for a\ntreatment option that minimizes hospitalization and recovery time while\nensuring favorable clinical and cosmetic outcomes. Cryoablation is a\nnonsurgical minimally invasive technique using extreme cold temperatures to\ndestroy benign or malignant tumors that meet those requirements. In recent\nyears, it has made rapid progress in clinical studies for early-stage breast\ncancer, exhibiting local control rates comparable to those achieved in breast-\nconserving surgery [13\u201315].

According to\nthe WHO, the global breast cancer incidence in 2022 was 2.3 million, with\n670,000 deaths (1). Cancer typically elicits psychological reactions\ncharacterized by traumatic stress (2) and requires treatment with extreme\ncaution due to the negative connotation associated with the term \u201ccancer\u201d (2,\n3). Patients who are diagnosed with cancer experience profoundly intense\npsychological reactions, including a sense of impending death. As a result,\ndeath anxiety is widely regarded as the most important psychological factor\naffecting cancer management. Death anxiety is the emotional reaction that\nindividuals exhibit when they encounter negative thoughts associated with\ndeath (4). It can harm cancer patients' psychological wellbeing, potentially\nleading to mental disorders and reduced overall quality of life (5, 6).\nFurthermore, death anxiety has a significant effect on cancer treatment and\neradication (7). Cancer patients reported moderate levels of death anxiety,\nwith women diagnosed with breast cancer reporting higher levels (8). According\nto Masror Roudsary et al.'s (9) study in Iran, 79% of patients with breast\ncancer have a fear of death. Furthermore, a cross-sectional study conducted in\nPakistan on 80 patients with breast cancer revealed that 13.8%, 51.2%, 27.5%,\nand 7.5% of the patients had low, medium, high, and very high levels of death\nanxiety, respectively (10).\n\nA fear of death among people arises from various reasons, including identity\nloss, anxiety about life after death, pain and distress, and loved ones'\nwellbeing. Fear of death affects patients' prognoses, leading to treatment\nskepticism or discontinuation (11). Many studies have explored cancer patients\nand their families' fear of death (3, 12\u201315). However, it is unclear what\nearly-stage patients experience in terms of fear of death because most\npublished research focuses on the terminally ill (16). Shakeri et al. (3)\nfound that death anxiety scores in patients with breast cancer was 67.5%.\nWomen harbored apprehensions about mortality, exacerbation of their illness,\nloss of their future, and dependence on other people (3).\n\nWomen diagnosed with breast cancer adopt coping strategies to navigate the\ncomplex and multifaceted challenges that arise from the psychological, social,\nand spiritual aspects of their new life circumstances (17). They must adjust\nto the changes that happen every day to lessen their pain and improve their\nquality of life (18). Coping is the mindset and actions adopted to maintain\nemotional health during cancer complications (19). Researchers found that\npatients with critical and terminal illnesses who use coping mechanisms live\nlonger and increase life satisfaction (20).

The anticancer\neffects of hawthorn are primarily attributed to various mechanisms, including\nthe inhibition of cancer cell growth through suppressing cancer cell\nproliferation, halting the cell cycle, triggering cancer cell apoptosis, and\nregulating autophagy; Hawthorn also limits the migration, invasion, and\nadhesion of cancer cells, thereby hindering the carcinogenesis process by\nobstructing the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), restraining\nangiogenesis, regulating tumor cell EMT and the tumor microenvironment (TME);\nFurthermore, hawthorn averts cancer progression by inducing the generation of\nROS and inhibiting the synthesis of inflammatory molecules during\ncarcinogenesis.\n\n4.1 Inhibition of cancer cell proliferation\n\nThe formidable capacity for proliferation displayed by cancer cells is among\nthe primary factors contributing to their resistance to effective elimination.\nThis ceaseless proliferation additionally imposes a substantial burden on the\nbody. Therefore, the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation has arisen as a\npivotal strategy in the treatment of cancer. In contemporary scientific\nresearch, the utilization of separation and purification technology is\ncommonly employed to investigate novel compound information found in distinct\nmedicinal sections of hawthorn. To validate its efficacy in combating cancer,\nexperiments assessing cytotoxicity are commonly conducted (Hsiao and Liu,\n2010; Zimmermann-Klemd et al., 2022).\n\nBuilding on this concept, neolignans with antioxidant activity have been\nsuccessfully isolated from hawthorn seeds (Huang et al., 2013a; Li L. Z. et\nal., 2013; Huang et al., 2013b), demonstrating significant inhibition of\ncancer cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. Research on the medicinal\npotential of hawthorn leaves revealed that methanol, acetone (Mohammedsaeed\nand Mohamad, 2023), and ethyl acetate extracts (Mustapha et al., 2015) exhibit\nnotable anti-proliferative effects on cancer cells.

The active monomer\ncomponents and extracts in hawthorn serve as the foundation for its\npharmacological effects. A thorough examination of these components is\nessential for uncovering hawthorn\u2019s anticancer mechanism, offering significant\nscientific research and clinical implications (Cui et al., 2024). As more\nstudies on hawthorn\u2019s anticancer properties emerge in the medical field, the\nexploration of its anticancer mechanism continues to progress. The anticancer\neffects of hawthorn are primarily attributed to various mechanisms, including\nthe inhibition of cancer cell growth through suppressing cancer cell\nproliferation, halting the cell cycle, triggering cancer cell apoptosis, and\nregulating autophagy; Hawthorn also limits the migration, invasion, and\nadhesion of cancer cells, thereby hindering the carcinogenesis process by\nobstructing the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), restraining\nangiogenesis, regulating tumor cell EMT and the tumor microenvironment (TME);\nFurthermore, hawthorn averts cancer progression by inducing the generation of\nROS and inhibiting the synthesis of inflammatory molecules during\ncarcinogenesis.\n\n4.1 Inhibition of cancer cell proliferation\n\nThe formidable capacity for proliferation displayed by cancer cells is among\nthe primary factors contributing to their resistance to effective elimination.\nThis ceaseless proliferation additionally imposes a substantial burden on the\nbody. Therefore, the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation has arisen as a\npivotal strategy in the treatment of cancer. In contemporary scientific\nresearch, the utilization of separation and purification technology is\ncommonly employed to investigate novel compound information found in distinct\nmedicinal sections of hawthorn. To validate its efficacy in combating cancer,\nexperiments assessing cytotoxicity are commonly conducted (Hsiao and Liu,\n2010; Zimmermann-Klemd et al., 2022).\n\nBuilding on this concept, neolignans with antioxidant activity have been\nsuccessfully isolated from hawthorn seeds (Huang et al., 2013a; Li L. Z. et\nal., 2013; Huang et al., 2013b), demonstrating significant inhibition of\ncancer cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. Research on the medicinal\npotential of hawthorn leaves revealed that methanol, acetone (Mohammedsaeed\nand Mohamad, 2023), and ethyl acetate extracts (Mustapha et al., 2015) exhibit\nnotable anti-proliferative effects on cancer cells. Triterpenoids (Min et al.,\n2000) and total flavonoids (Tang et al., 2010; Diao et al., 2019) isolated\nfrom these extracts also showed promise in inhibiting cancer cell activity.\nHawthorn buds extract displayed significant cytotoxicity in four human cancer\ncell lines (Rodrigues et al., 2012), while the petroleum ether extract of\nhawthorn stems exhibited stronger inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and\npromotion of apoptosis compared to water and ethanol extracts (Maldonado-Cubas\net al., 2020).

Moreover, we elucidated that\nmiR-25-3p may be transported by CT-EXO to suppress osteogenic differentiation\nand autophagy in BMSCs by targeting SATB2.

By inhibiting cartilage formation, cold exposure may\nshorten the limbs of homeotherms [10]. Studies done so far provide strong\nevidence that warmth reduces bone loss by influencing the gut microbiome [9].\nDu et al. found that brown adipose tissue rescues bone loss induced by cold\nexposure after cold exposure for 1 month [45]. Our findings indicate that a\n2-month cold exposure treatment significantly reduces bone mass. Furthermore,\nour data revealed that cold exposure also increases the senescence of bone\ntissues. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the senescence of bone and\nthe onset of osteopenia are associated with decreased autophagic activity [27,\n28, 46]. From our results, we also established that cold exposure can inhibit\nbone autophagy. These findings offer novel evidence suggesting that cold\nexposure promotes bone aging by suppressing autophagic activity, thereby\ncontributing to bone loss.\n\nExosomes have been regarded as key mediators of cell\u2013cell communication since\nthey carry numerous molecules such as proteins, lipids, and RNA [18]. Exosomes\ncan be detected in various bodily fluids, including plasma, saliva, breast\nmilk, sweat, tears, and urine [47\u201350].

Rats can be exposed to such agents via a single\nradiation dose, systemically delivered to the entire body, or, though less\nfrequently performed, a local dose, administered to a specific body part [108,\n233]. Regardless of the radiological agent and administration mode, irradiated\nrats appear to undergo a similar somatic mutational reaction to the radiation,\nleading to the development of corresponding mammary tumor identities [239,\n242]. Such tumors have been shown to develop within approximately 140 days to\nup to one year succeeding radiation exposure, with neoplasm incidence being\ndirectly proportional to the dose given [137, 243].\n\nRadiation-induced mammary carcinogenesis in the rat is a result of two main\nmolecular events, namely DNA damage, through double strand breaks, and the\ngeneration of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, both triggered by DNA and\nprotein oxidation [137, 244]. DNA damage consequently leads to mutations, copy\nnumber losses, deletions, chromosomal amplification, and an overall increased\ngenomic instability, making cells prone to tumorigenesis [137]. Specifically,\nLoree et al.\u2018s [234] study on irradiated rat mammary tissue has indicated\ngenome-wide hypomethylation, accompanied by down-regulation of the expression\nof DNA methyltransferases.

Conversely, the number of\nKi-67-positive cells was markedly downregulated by Flag-VHL, and this\ndownregulation was restored by Myc-UBE3B (Fig. 4D, F), suggesting that VHL\nimpedes cell proliferation by suppressing UBE3B. Similarly, control, VHL-KD#1,\nand VHL-KD#1+UBE3B-KD T47D cells were injected into the fat pad of female NOD-\nSCID mice. T47D tumor growth was significantly increased when VHL was\ndepleted, and this augmented tumor growth was effectively attenuated by UBE3B\nablation (Fig. S4A\u2013C). In line with findings in MDA-MB-231 tumors, the\nincreased cell proliferation and decreased cell death in VHL-KD#1 T47D tumors\nwere alleviated by UBE3B depletion (Fig. S4D\u2013F).

Despite 5-year survival rates approaching 90% in North America\nfor patients with BC, nearly 700,000 women died from BC in 2020 worldwide1,2.\nAlongside, the prevalence of obesity (defined as a body mass index (BMI) \u2265 30\nkg/m2) increased excessively worldwide, rising from 7 to 16% among women\nbetween 1975 and 20163. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of\ndeveloping at least 15 types of cancer, including postmenopausal BC4. Also,\nobesity is a prognostic disadvantage and is associated with shorter disease-\nfree survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in BC5,6.\n\nInflammation is a hallmark of cancer7 and systemic inflammation is associated\nwith poor BC prognosis8,9. Obesity is associated with low-grade inflammation10\nand elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP)11, also among BC patients12.\nThus, both obesity and systemic inflammation are associated with inferior BC\noutcomes. Yet, it is not clear if BC patients with obesity and high levels of\nsystemic inflammation have a poorer prognosis compared with patients with\nobesity and lower levels of systemic inflammation.\n\nCRP is an acute-phase protein released from the liver upon stimulation from\ncytokines such as interleukin 613. CRP is part of the inflammatory cascade and\na marker of systemic inflammation14,15. CRP levels are increased in people\nwith obesity compared with their normal weight counterparts, and in cancer\npatients compared with healthy controls or patients with benign diseases16. A\nsystematic review by Savioli et al. concluded that high pre-operative CRP\nlevels were associated with an increased risk of BC-specific mortality and\nall-cause mortality17. Likewise, in a meta-analysis from 2011, Han et al.\nreported an association between elevated CRP levels and lower OS and DFS18. A\nmeta-analysis by Mikkelsen et al. found that high CRP was an indicator of poor\nprognosis in metastatic BC, but the prognostic value in non-metastatic early\nBC could not be confirmed19.\n\nAs such, CRP levels may be prognostic in BC but only three studies have\ninvestigated this relationship across BMI groups, and they reported\nconflicting results20\u201322.

Therefore, the defined dosage range of\nITCs for their hormetic effect may vary due to the complexity of the\nmechanisms when ITCs and other anticancer agents work simultaneously. For\ninstance, a lower dose of sulforaphane (SFN) at 2.5 \u03bcM can protect cardiac\ncells from the toxicity of doxorubicin, thereby enhancing the therapeutic\nwindow (92). Additionally, up to 1.5 \u03bcM SFN can enhance cisplatin sensitivity\nthrough the accumulation of intracellular cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells\n(82). Conversely, 10 \u03bcM of SFN can reduce cancer cell resistance to\nconventional anticancer drugs like cisplatin and paclitaxel, working\nsynergistically to enhance the cytotoxic effects on cancer cells (83, 93).\nThis dual capability underscores the potential of SFN to improve overall\ntherapeutic efficacy. Therefore, a nuanced approach to dose selection in\ncombination therapies is essential to maximize anticancer effects while\nminimizing potential adverse effects.\n\nMoreover, the influence of ITCs on individuals with undetected tumors remains\ninadequately understood. There is a potential scenario where ITCs could offer\nprotection against the formation of these tumors. Conversely, they could also\ninadvertently stimulate the growth of pre-existing yet undiagnosed\nmalignancies (30). This highlights the need for comprehensive risk assessment\nand personalized dietary recommendations, particularly for individuals at high\nrisk of cancer or those with a family history of the disease.\n\nAnother consideration is the variability in individual responses to ITCs,\nwhich can be influenced by genetic factors such as polymorphisms in genes\nrelated to detoxification enzymes (30). These genetic differences can affect\nthe metabolism and bioavailability of ITCs, leading to variations in their\nchemopreventive efficacy and potential risks. As such, personalized approaches\nto ITC intake that take into account genetic predispositions may be necessary\nto ensure safety and maximize the benefits of these compounds.\n\nIn light of these considerations, it is imperative to conduct more research to\nelucidate the mechanisms underlying the hormetic effects of ITCs and their\nimplications in cancer development and treatment. Studies should aim to\ndetermine the optimal doses of ITCs for chemoprevention, identify potential\ninteractions with anticancer drugs, and assess the safety of ITC consumption\nin individuals with undetected tumors. Additionally, research should explore\nthe genetic factors that influence individual responses to ITCs, with the goal\nof developing personalized dietary guidelines for cancer prevention.\n\n4Discussion\n\nThe comprehensive exploration of ITCs within the context of cancer prevention\nand therapy showcases a promising avenue in oncology.

Evidence from epidemiological, in vitro, and\nin vivo studies underscores the protective role of ITCs, suggesting their\nsignificant contribution to reducing cancer risk and progression. One of the\nmost compelling aspects of ITC research is its potential to synergize with\nexisting chemotherapies.

The major\nimmune response to fungal infection is via the innate defence system with\nphagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages. Fungal cell walls are recognised\nthrough direct pattern recognition or via opsonisation with complement.\nCorticosteroids have multiple effects in increasing the MM risk by limiting\nvasodilation, preventing the egress of neutrophils at the infection site,\ninhibiting bone marrow production, releasing neutrophils and monocytes, and\nsuppressing phagolysosome membrane fusion in macrophages. They also inhibit\nfungal killing by reduction of oxidative products in the lysosome [16]. In\nvitro studies of glucocorticoids (dexamethasone and hydrocortisone) have been\nshown to increase the growth of Aspergillus, but this has not been shown with\nRhizopus [17].\n\nPrevention\n\nPrevention of the risk of MM infection is by reduction of dose and duration of\ncorticosteroids or cessation of them if it is safe.

This\nsubtype of breast cancer is known for its heterogeneous phenotypic structure,\naggressive clinical course, and highly invasive nature, leading to early\nmetastasis and poor prognosis. TNBC patients have shorter survival rates\ncompared to those with other breast cancer subtypes, largely due to its\nresistance to current treatments and the lack of effective targeted therapies\n[3\u20136]. Although a new targeted treatment strategy, Sacituzumab, a\nTrop-2-receptor-targeted antibody conjugated chemodrug (topoisomerase\ninhibitor) for metastatic TNBC, was approved by the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) in 2020, and the overall response rate remains low with a\nmedian duration of response of only 7.7 months. Immunotherapy has limited\neffect only a small fraction of patients. Consequently, there is an urgent\nneed to identify new molecular targets and develop effective therapeutic\nstrategies to improve prognosis and poor survival rates in TNBC patients [5,\n7].\n\nFOXM1 is a proto-oncogenic transcription factor that belongs to the Forkhead\nbox (FOX) family and plays critical roles in regulating cycle progression, DNA\ndamage response, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis and tumorigenesis [7,\n8].

The increased activity of FOXM1 in TNBC\ncontributes to multiple aspects of tumor progression and therapy resistance.\nGenetic targeting of FOXM1 by RNAi-based strategies have been shown to\nsuppress TNBC tumor growth in mice [13], suggesting it as a promising\ncandidate for targeted therapies in TNBC [13, 14].

Therefore, changes in the levels of proteins that\ncontrol the production, breakdown, and storage of lipids have been extensively\ndocumented in cancerous cells (Lodhi and Semenkovich, 2014). An example is\nwhen breast malignancies have increased HER2/neu, often followed by an\namplification of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3)\nbinding protein (PBP) gene. This may be because these genes are located close\nto each other on chromosome 17q12\u201321 (Kauraniemi et al., 2001). Curiously, the\nSTAT3 gene is also situated near these genetic locations, specifically at\nchromosome 17q 21.2. Both the overexpression of PBP and the activity of STAT3\nboost the transcriptional activity of PPAR\u03b3, a significant lipid metabolism\nregulator and an essential mediator of adipogenesis and adipocyte\ndifferentiation (Wang C. et al., 2009; Kourtidis et al., 2009). Moreover, both\nthe process of synthesizing fatty acids (controlled by the enzyme FASN) and\nthe process of FAO are frequently increased in cancerous cells (Figure 4A)\n(Yoshii et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018c). FASN-mediated de novo fatty acid\nsynthesis and anabolic-driven growth, survival, and migration can be initiated\nby activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK and by overexpressing HER/neu (Fhu and\nAli, 2020). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that STAT3 activation\nincreases the expression of FASN (Gao et al., 2020). The connection between\nFASN inhibition and trastuzumab resistance reversal in HER2-positive breast\ntumors has therapeutic potential (Vazquez-Martin et al., 2007). Furthermore,\nthe breakdown of fatty acids (FA) through FAO promotes the growth of tumors by\nsupplying ATP to meet the energy requirements of cells during metabolic stress\ncaused by a lack of glucose (Qu et al., 2016). Activation of leptin, IL-6, or\nSTAT3 through other mechanisms stimulates the production of carnitine\npalmitoyltransferase 1B (CPT1B), an enzyme that controls the rate of fatty\nacid oxidation (Koo et al., 2019). This pathway plays a key function in the\nself-renewal of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) and enhances their ability to\nsurvive chemotherapy. The process of FAO generates NADH and FADH2, which can\ndecrease oxidative stress and increase ATP synthesis through the electron\ntransport system (Koundouros and Poulogiannis, 2020). FAO also produces\nacetyl-CoA, which can be used for energy production via the Krebs cycle or for\nthe generation of fatty acids and protein acetylation. These processes have\nthe potential to stimulate tumor growth. Conforming to this correlation, the\naddition of acetyl-CoA partially counteracted the impacts of suppressing STAT3\non the growth and viability of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). Furthermore,\nthe augmentation of FAO plays a crucial role in the emergence of\nchemoresistance in several malignant systems, such as AML and breast, lung,\nand stomach malignancies. Inhibiting this route hinders the abnormal\nproliferation of cancer cells and restores their sensitivity to chemotherapy\n(Li J. et al., 2013; He et al., 2019).

To validate the\nclinical application of the mtPCD signature, we integrated the clinical\ninformation of the patients, including survival time, survival status, age,\ngender, and TNM staging (Supplementary Table S3). Univariate and multivariate\nCox regression analyses were used to assess the effects of clinical\ncharacteristics and mtPCD on BLCA survival. The results showed that risk score\nand N stage could be used as independent prognostic factors (Fig. 4B). Using\nthese predictors, we designed a nomogram (Fig. 4C) and published the\npredictive model online (https://urology-yanzw.shinyapps.io/DynNomapp/) to\nestimate the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival probabilities of BLCA patients.

Ultimately, activation of the complement\nsystem leads to the formation of a membrane attack complex (MAC), a pore\nstructure on the cell membrane that causes osmotic imbalance, leading to cell\nlysis. Recent discoveries of the complosome have demonstrated non-canonical\nfunctions of the complement system apart from its canonical functions in\nimmune defense, including opsonization, inflammation, and cell lysis. A\nsummary of the intracellular and extracellular complement system is shown in\nFigure 1.\n\n3.1. Internalization Mechanisms of Complement Proteins\n\nComplement proteins are not only produced intracellularly but can also be re-\ningested and retro-translocated into the cell. For instance, King et al. found\nthat C3 contains alternative ATG start codons, enabling its translation in the\ncytosol [32]. They discovered that this form of C3 loses the ability to be\nsecreted and can rescue autophagy in cells with C3 knockout, whereas uptake of\nextracellular C3 does not achieve this. Additionally, C3 can be produced and\nsecreted, then taken up again by the same cell. For example, Kremlitzka et al.\ndemonstrated that alternative translation start sites of C3 result in the\nproduction of the cytosolic form of C3 without glycosylation, exhibiting\ndistinct functions compared to the serum form [33]. The same study also showed\nthat intracellular C3 is retro-translocated from the ER to the cytosol [33].\nSimilarly, Golec et al. suggested that CD59 is retro-translocated from the ER\nto the cytosol, and that cytosolic CD59 lacks a glycosylphosphatidylinositol\n(GPI) anchor [34]. While silencing CD59 resulted in dysregulated insulin\nproduction, removing the GPI anchor did not do so, suggesting the existence of\nan intracellular, non-GPI-anchored pool of CD59 that functions in insulin\nsecretion [34]. Together, this evidence suggests that intracellular complement\nproteins such as C3 and CD59 have unique genetic and functional profiles,\ninvolving intracellular production, retro-translocation, and distinct roles in\ncellular processes, diverging significantly from their extracellular\ncounterparts.\n\n3.2. Intracellular Complement System\n\nThe complement system is predominantly recognized as a liver-derived and\nserum-circulating extracellular system. Although most complement factors are\nproduced in the liver and secreted, C3 and C5 can also be produced and\nsecreted by T cells [6,9]. Serum complement components can bind to receptors\non the surface of T cells to induce effector function and intracellular C3 and\nC5 production [35,36]. Additionally, C3 and C5 can be activated\nintracellularly in T cells [9,37]. While the majority of complement is\nsystemic, local production by specific cell types serves specific functions\n[37]. For example, C1q is mostly/only produced by immune cells including\nmacrophages and dendritic cells [37,38,39].

Sertraline\n\nAmong the SSRIs, sertraline, a first-line antidepressant agent, has been\nwidely considered in clinical studies due to encouraging results portraying\nits ability to elicit anti-tumour properties in various cancers such as\ncolorectal, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers [50]. These findings\nunderscore the role of sertraline in modifying serotonin levels within the\ntumour microenvironment, effectively reducing the viability, growth, and\nproliferation of aggressive cancer cell lines [51].\n\nSertraline has been perceived to elicit an anti-tumour effect by reversing\nmultidrug resistance mechanisms in numerous malignant tumours. For instance, a\nstudy investigated by Gil-Ad and his team evaluated the effect of sertraline\non both human colon carcinoma (HT29) and MRD colorectal cancer (LS1034) cell\nlines [52]. They reported sertraline to reduce cell viability, induce\napoptotic cell death, increase activity of caspaspe-3, and increase expression\nof antiapoptotic protooncogenes (p53, Bcl-2, and c-Jun) in both HT29 and\nLS1034 cell lines when treated with 10 and 20 \u00b5M of sertraline. Therefore,\ntheir results tend to support the use of sertraline as an anti-cancer drug due\nto their superiority in inducing cytotoxicity in both carcinoma and multidrug\nresistance cell lines. Furthermore, sertraline has been shown to be an\neffective chemosensitizer when combined with conventional chemotherapeutic\ndrugs such as cisplatin and doxorubicin. As such, a study highlighted by\nBaldisseri and his team investigated the effect of sertraline on translational\ncontrolled tumour protein (TCTP) on different breast cancer cell lines (PMC\n42, MCF7, SKBR3, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-4360) [53]. TCTP is a protein and\nhistamine-releasing factor conserved in eukaryotic stem cells, often\nassociated with contributing to the prosurvival of cancer cells and promoting\ntheir ability to confer malignant phenotypes and resist apoptosis induced by\nchemotherapy [54]. Baldisseri and the team reported that cell lines with\noverexpressed TCTP levels, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-4360, were sensitized with\nsertraline before the addition of chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin and\ndoxorubicin), resulting in a more effective cytotoxic effect than when treated\nalone. They observed a decrease in cell viability of 55% and 64%, compared to\n25% and 45% when treated with cisplatin and doxorubicin alone. Thus, their\ndata suggest that the combination of sertraline with chemotherapeutic agents\ncan enhance patient response, promote remission, and potentially reduce the\nrisk of relapse [53].\n\nAlthough numerous studies have underscored the antitumour role of sertraline,\nthe exact molecular mechanism behind its effect remains unknown. However,\nrecent research indicates an association between serotonin and YAP signalling\nexists. It is suggested that elevated levels of intercellular serotonin may\npromote tumour growth and sustain cell proliferation by enhancing the\ntransduction of YAP signalling. This aspect was investigated in a study by Yu\nand his team, which explored the impact of serotonin and different SSRIs\n(citalopram and fluvoxamine) on various colon cancer cell lines (SW480 and\nSW1116) [55]. Initially, they found that serotonin stimulates cell\nproliferation through 5-HT signals, supporting the idea of serotonin as a\nmitogenic factor that\n\n", "question": "What is the role of sertraline in modulating cancer cell behaviors?", "answer": "Sertraline has been perceived to elicit an anti-tumour effect by reversing multidrug resistance mechanisms in numerous malignant tumours."}

It could also be the activation of other proteins that\nassociate with the methyltransferases directing them to the cytoplasm and\ntarget mRNAs.

The incidence and mortality of\nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are rapidly increasing over time since patients\nare diagnosed in advanced stage while effective interventions are limited [2].\nThe liver is a critical hub for numerous physiological processes, including\nmacronutrient metabolism, immune system support, glucose, and lipid metabolism\n[3]. Mitochondria are powerhouse of the cell, also serve as the defensive\nmachinery maintaining cellular redox homeostasis in hepatocytes [4, 5]. Iron\nis the most prevalent metal in mitochondria, where iron is utilized for\nsynthesis of cofactors essential to mitochondrial metabolic enzymes and\nsupporting the electron transport chain to generate ATP, thus mitochondrial\niron levels are tightly associated with mitochondrial energy metabolism [5].\nMoreover, Iron plays an important role in cancer biology [6]. The negative\neffects of iron overload have been linked to HCC development [7]. Dysregulated\niron metabolism has been identified as a metabolic hallmark of malignant\ncancer cells [8]. Iron deficiency inhibits HCC proliferation but promotes HCC\nprogression and metastasis [9, 10], suggesting a critical role of iron\ndynamics in HCC progression.\n\nFerroptosis, a form of programmed cell death driven by iron-dependent lipid\nperoxidation which has emerged as a novel form of cell death, is highly\nrelevant to chemotherapy of HCC [11, 12]. Oxidative stress and impaired redox\nhomeostasis are necessary to induce ferroptosis [13]. Sorafenib, a ferroptosis\ninducer, is the first-line therapy for patients with HCC in advanced stage\n[14]. Unfortunately, most patients did not experience a long-term benefit\nbecause of early emergence of sorafenib resistance (Only approximately 30% of\npatients can benefit from sorafenib, and this population usually acquires drug\nresistance within half a year) [15]. The mechanisms underlying sorafenib\nresistance remain elusive. Emerging evidence show that iron deficiency\nmediating upregulation of HIF1-alpha leads to sorafenib resistance, suggesting\na pivotal role of iron dynamics involving sorafenib sensitivity [16]. Iron\nhomeostasis requires several transporters for iron entry and release from the\ncell and mitochondria, including TF/TFRC for iron uptake into the cell,\nMFRN1/MFRN2 for iron transporting into mitochondria, SLC40A1 and CISD1 for\niron release from the cell and mitochondria [17]. CISD1 is a redox-sensitive\nprotein with 2Fe-2S clusters to regulate mitochondrial iron content [18, 19],\nand plays a vital role in regulating lipid metabolism, cancer cell\nproliferation [20, 21], and erastin-induced ferroptosis [22].

As a result, the mTOR is inhibited by the TSC2\n(Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2). When ATP levels are restored or normalized to\nsustain cellular needs, mTOR inhibition is suppressed by the decreased\nactivity of the LKB1 complex, as previously reported [73,74,75,86].\nFurthermore, ketone body production from the liver is used by peripheral\ntissues as a source of energy during fasting [62].

Interestingly, one study\nconducted by Wohlauer et al. in 2017 noted that AAA patients with albumin <2.4\ng/dL had a significantly elevated 30-day mortality (odds ratio 4.967 (97% CI\n1.385\u201317.814), p = 0.025) compared to those with higher albumin [31].\nSimilarly, Inagaki et al. in the same year noted that those with low albumin\n(\u22643.5 g/dL) had a higher 1-year mortality. They noted that 4.0 g/dL could be\nused as a cut-off for low albumin, giving an AUC of 0.885, (95% CI\n0.821\u20130.949, p < 0.001) and a sensitivity and specificity of 90.0 and 80.3\npercent, respectively [89].\n\n3.4. Inflammation and Immunity\n\nThe formation of AAA is a multifactorial process; however, it has been\nhypothesized that inflammation plays a central role in the initiation and\nprogression of the disease. It is suggested that AAA may initiate through an\ninitial immune response to an antigen with in the aortic wall, leading to the\ninfiltration of immune cells and the release of cytokines, initiating a\ncascade of events leading to arctic dilation [90]. Several studies of AAA\ntissue samples have noted infiltration of inflammatory cells such as\nmacrophages, natural killer cells (NK cells), T and B lymphocytes, mast cells,\nand neutrophils [91,92]. This occurs due to the release of cytokines and\nchemokines in response to vascular endothelial damage and platelet aggregation\n[67,92]. A subtype of AAAs, known as Inflammatory AAA (IAAA), is rare (5\u201310%\nof all AAA cases), with a higher mortality, higher likelihood of being\nsymptomatic, and a higher likelihood of surgical complications [93,94,95,96].\nDocumenting inflammatory markers and determining strong biomarkers of\ninflammation within the AAA may be beneficial in the early prognostication of\nthe disease.\n\n3.4.1. Elastase\n\nElastase is a serine protease enzyme which is produced by the acinar cells of\nthe pancreas. Elastase is a digestive enzyme and it is involved in the\nbreakdown of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins to facilitate energy, growth,\nand cell repair in the body [97]. The aorta is an elastic artery composed of\nvascular smooth muscle and elastin.

Interestingly, neither of them had an\nantiviral effect on HCV in our study.\n\nOne of the most unexpected results of the study is the nonstandard response of\nHuh7.5 cells and especially the cells harbouring HCV replicon to the treatment\nwith compounds that target polyamine-metabolizing enzymes such as DENSpm and\nespecially DFMO. First, Huh7.5 cells demonstrated high resistance to DENSpm:\nthis compound caused only a moderate reduction in spermine and spermidine\nlevels upon treatment, and the cells remained viable even upon treatment with\n300 \u00b5M of the drug (Figure S1). Second, the cells also demonstrated resistance\nto DFMO, which is an irreversible inhibitor of ODC: at subtoxic\nconcentrations, this drug decreased intracellular ODC activity by two-fold\nonly. Third, the treatment of cells containing the HCV replicon led to an\nunprecedented elevation of the levels of both spermine and spermidine. It\ncould be speculated that the effect may be due either to enhanced polyamine\nimport from serum in the culture medium or by some nonstandard feedback\nmechanism by which the cells counteract polyamine depletion. Such an effect\nwas previously described by J. Janne\u2019s group, which raised DFMO-resistant\nhuman and murine leukaemia cell lines by maintaining cells in the presence of\nsubtoxic drug concentrations and then observed either multiplication of the\nODC1 gene or its enhanced transcription [75]. In the presence of DFMO, this\ncell line enhanced ODC expression to counteract the inactivation of the enzyme\nby the drug. Although we have not quantified ODC1 copy numbers in Huh7.5 cells\nwith the HCV replicon, it cannot be excluded that ODC1 multiplication occurs\nduring the selection of the cells, possibly mediated via HCV-enhanced ROS\nproduction [31,70].\n\nHere, we show that HCV decreases the expression of ARGI and thus causes\naccumulation of its substrate arginine in the infected Huh7.5 cells. So far,\nthe data on expression of Arginase 1 in the context of HCV infection have been\ndiscrepant. Several groups did not find any changes in Arg1 expression in\nliver samples of chronic hepatitis C virus patients without signs of steatosis\n[76,77], while others observed increased staining of the enzyme in biopsy\nsections [78]. However, Arg1 down-regulation was also reported for Huh7.5\ncells harbouring the full-length HCV replicon [79]. Decreased expression of\nArg1 and concomitant accumulation of arginine could be the feature of\nhepatocarcinoma cells during non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and metabolic\nsyndrome [80]. So, we cannot rule out that down-regulation of Arg1 during HCV\nexpression can contribute to viral pathogenesis.\n\nCell metabolism is affected not only by the virus but also by the culture\nmedium. Almost all studies are performed in cell lines maintained in classical\nmedia (such as MEM, DMEM, RPMI, F12, etc.) formulated in the 1950s or early\n1960s [46].

Tumor-infiltrating\npDCs have both negative and positive impacts depending on the tumor type [50].\npDCs can present antigens and activate CD8+ T cells via MHCII and co-\nstimulating molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86.

MoDCs also can cross-present antigens to prime the CD8+ T cell response.\nHowever, the transcriptional program in MoDCs is distinct from cDCs. GM-CSF-\nderived MoDCs depend on IRF4 and IL-4 for cross-presentation but not Batf3\n[55]. MoDCs share some phenotypical and functional features with monocytes and\ncDC2. A recent study demonstrated that two subtypes of MoDCs (MoDC1 and MoDC2)\ndifferentiated from Ly6Chi monocytes in mouse TME. MoDCs expressed high levels\nof MHC I, MHCII, and CD86. MoDC1 expressed PD-L1 while MoDC2 mostly expressed\nCD155 [56]. In human melanoma, MoDCs expressed high levels of HLA-DR, CD1c,\nCLEC10A, CD11c, and cystatin F (CST7). Also, CD86, PU.1, ILT3, CSF1R, and\nCD11b were upregulated in MoDCs and cDC2 in PD1 checkpoint blockade responders\n[56].

This section presents recent studies and\ndetails of ML models, datasets, and evaluation metrics, which are also\nsummarised in Table 6.\n\nExamining the size and shape of remaining metastases is a crucial aspect of\npost-treatment evaluation of resectable tumors [85]. Pan et al. proposed to\nautomate this examination process using an ML model that quantifies spatial\nfeatures of metastases in mice after receiving therapeutic monoclonal antibody\n(for carbonic anhydrase XII) treatment for pancreatic, breast, and lung\ncancer. Amplified 3-D full-body fluorescence light microscopy was performed to\ncollect 3D image data from the antibody-treated mice.

With an F-1 score of 80%, the model accounted for 29% increased\ndetection of micro-metastases compared to a physician\u2019s manual identification.\nThe authors state that, through this model, the detection of micro-metastases\ncan reveal which regions are targeted by the clonal antibody therapy.\nSimilarly, detecting micro-metastases across the entire body provides the data\nrequired to elucidate why certain regions are eliminated by antibody therapy,\nand others are not.\n\nPost-treatment surveillance data in resected pancreatic lesions can guide\npersonalized treatment of PDAC patients with early-stage disease [32].\nTypically, chemotherapy regimens are administered through adjuvant or\nneoadjuvant means based on the physician\u2019s decision, and the combination of\nresection plus chemotherapy yields promising results [22]. Of these\nchemotherapy regimens, mFOLFIRINOX is considered the state-of-the-art, showing\nthe best overall survival outcomes, but gemcitabine and gemcitabine plus\ncapecitabine are also commonly used [87]. However, it is seen that different\nchemotherapy regimens affect the morphological nuclear characteristics of the\nresected tumors in neoadjuvant therapy differently. Krishna et al. explored\nthis relationship by calculating the correlation between morphological nuclear\nbiomarkers of a resected PDAC tumor and the therapy that it received [87]. To\nderive morphological nuclear tumor features, the authors developed a\nsegmentation model on 139 histopathology slides of resected pancreatic tumors\nreceiving gemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX. Although the exact architecture of the\nmodel was not specified, the segmentation model extracted nuclear features of\nthe histopathology slides and correlated them against disease-specific\nsurvival. The concordance index (C-index) was measured for correlations\nbetween each nuclear morphological feature against disease-specific survival,\nwhere the tumor was treated with either gemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX treatment\n[87]. The promising results showed that elliptical features in the nuclei\ngeometry had a strong correlation with gemcitabine treatment. No statistical\ncorrelation linked 5-FU patients\u2019 geometric nuclei features to disease-\nspecific survival, indicating the model was more appropriate for gemcitabine-\ntreated patients.\n\nThe evaluation of the effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for treating\nPDAC tumors can also be performed through the tumor response scoring system\n(TRS), a measure of residual tumor burden [86].

Additionally, depletion of monocytes resulted\nin restored T-cell proliferation. The suppression of T cells by myeloid cells\nwas associated with the release of interleukin-10 and S100A12, along with an\nincrease in PD-L1 expression [63]. Similar findings were observed in\nanaplastic DLBCL, where higher levels of MDSCs were associated with increased\nPD-L1 expression [64]. The most important idea of targeting MDSCs is increased\nactivity and the presence of cytotoxic T cells in the tumour niche, which\ncould increase the efficiency of the immune therapy and targeting PD-1/PD-1L\nwith drugs such as pembrolizumab.\n\n5\\. Tumour-Associated Neutrophils (TANs)\n\nNeutrophils are the largest group of immune/inflammatory cells in the\nperipheral blood, constituting around 50\u201370% of all leukocytes. These short-\nliving cells, having a life span around 7 h, are well known for their active\nresponse in acute inflammation scenarios [65]. Only recently, their role has\nstarted to be assessed from the perspectives of chronic inflammatory response\nand especially in the pathogenesis of the tumour microenvironment. In solid\ntumours, an abundance of neutrophils often correlates with poor outcome and\nprognosis, as reported in melanomas [66], bronchoalveolar carcinomas [67], or\nhead and neck squamous cell carcinomas [68]. Neutrophils in cancer patients\nexert a pro-tumoural or an anti-tumoural effect [16], which make their role\nambiguous in the TME. Neutrophils, similarly to the PMN-MDSCs, take their\norigin from multipotent granulocyte\u2013monocyte progenitors (GMPs) [69] and are\nstimulated by GM-CSF and G-CSF [70], by which they share a similar\nCD14\u2212CD15+CD66b+CD16+ phenotype [65,71]. Recruitment of the TANs is mediated\nthrough different chemokine receptors CXC-chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), CXCR4,\nand CXCR5 and their ligands. Expression of CXC-chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) by\nbone marrow stromal cells is responsible for retaining CXCR4+ immature\nneutrophils [72]. In hepatocellular carcinoma models, CXCR2 is activated via\nErk1/2, p38, and NF-\u03baB signals, and increases the life-span of the neutrophils\ntogether with pro-tumour effects. [73]. Polarisation of the TANs also plays a\ncrucial role in tumourigenesis. Significant impact on differentiation into the\nTANs N2 type or pro-tumourous TANs develops through the TGF-\u03b2 cytokine. This\nalso works negatively on the differentiation towards anti-tumourous or N1\ntype. A completely opposite process is involved in the appearance of N1-TANs,\nwhere the crucial molecule is INF-\u03b2 [74]. This fact shows plasticity of the\nTANs depending on the spectrum of secreted cytokines by tumour and surrounding\ntissues.

Based on the type of magnetic material\n(ferromagnetic, diamagnetic and paramagnetic) used and the magnetic field\nstrength used, the now MNP-covered CTCs will move in a specific way (based on\nattractive or repulsive interaction), which will eventually isolate the CTCs\nfrom other types of cells [16,17,18]. In recent years, various techniques have\nbeen proposed to isolate CTCs. Cha et al. proposed a novel method for\ncontinuous CTC isolation using lateral magnetophoresis and magnetic\nnanoparticles functionalized with both EpCAM and vimentin antibodies along\nwith a mesenchymal marker. The results indicate that using both antibodies\nsignificantly improved CTC isolation compared to using either of the\nbiomarkers alone [19].

By 12 months of a\nnew cancer diagnosis, cumulative incidences of ATE rose to 6.5% and 2.1% in\nthe SEER-Medicare and Danish cohorts, respectively [1,2]. It is important to\nrecognize that the SEER-Medicare database only included individuals \u226565 years\nand, therefore, comprised of an older group of patients compared to the Danish\npopulation-based study (median age 74 vs. 69 years).\n\nData from randomized, controlled trials that captured ATE as a co-efficacy\nendpoint support the cumulative incidences of ATE from observational cohorts\n(Table 1).

Parallelly, ZNF704 (zinc finger protein 704) overexpression\npromotes the growth and migration of UM cells, with its downregulation leading\nto dysregulation of SORBS3 (sorbin and SH3 domain containing 3) and activation\nof the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and\nmetastasis-related genes [181]. The FASN (fatty acid synthase) expression,\ncontrolled by the mTOR\u2013SREBP1 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1)\naxis, is upregulated in a choroidal melanocyte line transduced with GNAQQ209L\nand in UM cells mutated in GNAQ/GNA11 [182]. This study also shows that\ninhibiting FASN and mTOR not only suppresses UM cell growth but also induces\ncell cycle arrest and apoptosis [182]. Furthermore, ZNF704 operates through\nthe AKT/mTOR/glycolysis signaling pathways, and the restoration of UM tumor\ncell viability in ZNF704-silenced cells can be achieved by knocking down\nSORBS3 [181]. In a broader context, it is important to note that high\nexpression of mTORC1 signaling, related to these pathways, has been associated\nwith low OS in UM patients, underlining the clinical significance of these\nmolecular interactions [183]. Along with the reduced AMPK signaling, mTOR\nactivity was also observed to be lower in UM cells compared to normal\nchoroidal melanocytes, influenced by the energy-dependent LKB1 (liver kinase\nB1)-AMPK pathway [160]. The kinase LKB1, essential for UM cell proliferation,\nhas been demonstrated to be necessary, with its expression being regulated by\nHGF (hepatocyte growth factor) [184].\n\n4.4. Inflammatory Signaling Pathways\n\nWithin UM, several inflammatory signaling pathways, including IL6-JAK-STAT3,\nIL2-STAT5, INF-\u03b1/\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 pathways, exhibit significantly higher hazard\nratios [185]. Inflammation-related molecules, such as NF-\u03baB (NFKB1), COX-2\n(PTGS2) and CXCL10 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10), primarily expressed in\nthe macrophages, were linked to a poor prognosis in UM (reviewed in [186])\n[185]. BAP1-mutant UMs were found to suppress the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway,\ntherefore creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment by decreasing\ncytokine secretion and antigen-presenting capacity by macrophages [187]. A\ndistinctive signature consisting of nine inflammatory response-related mRNA\ntranscripts (PDE4B, RAF1, CXCL8, P2RX4, LPAR1, ITGA5, CCL24, ITGB3, CCL20) has\nbeen correlated with UM survival, highlighting ITGA5 (integrin alpha 5) and\nP2RX4 (P2X purinoceptor 4) as key mRNA transcripts [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"\n\n", "question": "What are the molecular interactions associated with low OS in UM patients?", "answer": "High expression of mTORC1 signaling, related to the AKT/mTOR/glycolysis signaling pathways."}

This upregulation can be counteracted by the compound KCN1, a\nhypoxia-inducible inhibitor, illustrating a potential therapeutic approach\ntargeting hypoxia influence on UM progression [201].\n\n4.7. MAPK Pathway\n\nActivating mutations in GNAQ/11 genes are prevalent in approximately 85% of UM\ncases, leading to the activation of the MAPK pathway. This aberrant signaling\ndrives UM progression and contributes to its malignancy [42]. There is growing\nevidence indicating that STING (stimulator of interferon genes, also known as\nTMEM173) plays a role in the development and spread of many tumors including\nUM [202,203,204]. STING encodes for a transmembrane protein found in the\nendoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, which is present in tissues associated\nwith the immune system, as well as some malignancies and tumors (reviewed in\n[205]). Not only is it more abundantly expressed in UM tissues compared to\nadjacent healthy tissues, but STING also enhances the invasion and migration\nof UM cells by increasing the activity of the p38-MAPK signaling pathway\n[204].\n\n4.8. JAK/STAT Pathway\n\nThe JAK/STAT signaling pathway, a critical mediator in various cellular\nfunctions, has emerged as a significant player in the progression of cancer,\nincluding UM, where its aberrant activation has been linked to increased\ngrowth, survival, and malignancy of tumor cells [9,10]. In UM GEPs, the HTR2B\n(5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2B) stands out as the most dysregulated mRNA\ntranscript in high-risk MUMs and has connections with the JAK/STAT pathway.\nStudies have demonstrated that STAT proteins augmented HTR2B expression\npositively in UM cell lines [206]. In an integrative multi-omics analysis of\nUM samples (n = 80) with loss of chromosome 3 called M3 iSubtype (iCluster;\nindicative of the worst survival), the IL6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway was\nidentified to be hypomethylated and increased in M3 tumors, in conjunction\nwith other pathways like angiogenesis, allograft rejection, inflammatory\nresponse IFN-\u03b3 response [207].

TRAIL is a molecule belonging to the tumor necrosis factor\nsuperfamily (TNF) [47]. Tumors express the TRAIL receptor and can signal\napoptosis upon binding of TRAIL [48]. While pDCs typically exhibit minimal\nsecretion of these cytotoxic agents in their resting state, the activation of\ntoll-like receptors (TLRs) was demonstrated to enable them, in ex vivo\nstudies, to effectively eliminate tumor cells originating from hematological\nmalignancies, breast cancer, and melanoma [49,50,51].\n\npDCs are recognized as the primary source of IFN-\u03b1, a cytokine possessing\nsignificant anti-tumor properties. Of particular significance is its role in\nactivating T cells and NK cells, both proficient in eliminating cancerous\ncells [52]. Moreover, IFN-\u03b1 stimulates the presentation of tumor antigens,\nthereby amplifying the adaptive immune response [53]. Additionally, IFN-\u03b1\nexerts a direct impact on tumor cells by impeding their growth and migration\n[54,55].\n\npDCs serve as antigen-presenting cells. Following activation, they upregulate\nMHC and T cell co-stimulatory molecules. Upon uptake of the tumor antigen,\nthey can migrate to lymphoid organs and present antigens via MHC I and II to\nCD8+ and CD4+ T cells [56]. This process initiates an adaptive immune response\nagainst the tumor.\n\nIn addition to IFN-\u03b1, pDCs are capable of producing TNF-\u03b1. This leads to\nincreased processing and presentation of tumor antigens, consequently\namplifying T cell activation [57]. Interestingly, TNF-\u03b1-producing pDCs exhibit\naltered functionality: they scarcely produce IFN-\u03b1 and display increased\nexpression of MHC I and II, along with the co-stimulatory molecules CD80,\nCD86, and CCR7 [58]. This underscores the complexity of pDC functionality,\nwhich may manifest differently across various cancer types or tumor stages.\nFigure 1 schematically depicts the anti-tumoral functions of pDCs.\n\n4\\.

Additionally, tumor-infiltrating pDCs in non-\nsmall-cell lung cancer produced IL-1\u03b1, a proangiogenic and proinvasive\ncytokine [61].

Specifically, images are categorized into four classes:\nNormal, Benign, In Situ Carcinoma, and Invasive Carcinoma (see Figure 1). The\nannotation process involved the assessment of each image by two medical\nexperts, with any disagreements resulting in the exclusion of the respective\nimage from the dataset. In total, the microscopy image dataset consisted of\n400 images, evenly distributed across the four classes, with each class\ncontaining 100 images.

Overall, current data indicate that increased MCP-1\nexpression in breast tumors is closely associated with disease progression,\nbut data on MCP-1 levels in body fluids are inconsistent.\n\nWe have shown that the content of TNF-\u03b1 increases in HER2-negative tumors,\nwith negative expression of estrogen receptors and a high index of\nproliferative activity, i.e., for aggressive subtypes of breast cancer (Figure\n6 and Figure 7). An increase in the level of TNF-\u03b1 was also noted with damage\nto regional lymph nodes (Figure 4). It is known that coexpression of IL6 and\nTNF-\u03b1 was associated with lymph node involvement and shorter survival [82],\nwhile RAS and TNF-\u03b1 together enhanced angiogenesis in breast cancer [83]. Some\nresearchers believe that the effect of TNF-\u03b1 on breast cancer growth is due\nnot only to its effect on the immune response but also to its ability to\ninduce the expression of angiogenic factors [84]. Activation of TNF-\u03b1 induces\ninvasive and malignant behavior in breast cancer cells [85], and its\noverexpression is associated with the regulation of genes and enzymes that\nmediate estrogen metabolism, leading to higher levels of DNA adducts [86].\nRoque showed that the expression levels of inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1\u03b2,\nIL-8, and TNF-\u03b1) are associated with DNA damage, which may represent a\npossible risk for breast cancer [87].\n\nRegarding the expression of VEGF, amino acids (Asp, Cit, and Trp)\nsignificantly change their concentration. At the same time, an increase in the\ncontent of Asp and Cit is observed. It is known that Cit is a participant in\nthe ornithine cycle in the liver for the synthesis of urea and ornithine and\nthe citrine-NO cycle in the vascular endothelium for the synthesis of nitric\noxide (NO) [88]. The substrate for NOS is L-arginine, resulting in the\nformation of NO and Cit [89,90].

This cycle is anaplerotic since fumarate reacts with water to\nform malate and is further integrated into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and\nL-arginine again acts as a substrate for NOS and the synthesis of NO and Cit\n[91]. It has been shown that NO under the influence of NOS-2 enhances\nangiogenesis via the activation of VEGF and suppresses immunity [92].\n\nDuring the study, we found significant changes in the concentrations of Gln,\nGly, and Pro.

CircRNAs can vary in length, ranging from less than 200 nt to more\nthan 3000 nt [108], and may contain one or more exons, as well as introns. The\ngeneration of circRNAs is dependent on the presence of both cis- and trans-\nacting factors. Among the cis-acting factors, complementary sequences (such as\nAlu repeats) in the flanking introns are necessary for the back-splicing\nmechanism. Trans acting factors can influence circRNA levels through various\nmechanisms: (1) affecting the probability of base pairing of reverse\ncomplementary sequences [e.g. ADAR1, which mediates adenine to inosine\n(A-to-I) conversions]; (2) stabilizing the double-strand RNA duplex (e.g.\nNF90/NF110); (3) or disrupting the double-strand RNA duplex (e.g. DHX9) [109].\n\nCircular RNAs are usually more stable of their linear counterpart [110]. Their\nformation is dynamically regulated in a tissue-specific and developmentally\ndependent manner [92]. The precise mechanisms governing circRNA degradation\nare not yet fully understood and appear to be multifaceted. Degradation\nmechanisms may involve the action of Ago2, RNase L (a cytoplasmic\nendonuclease) or, in the case of circRNA modified with the N6-methyladenosine\n(m6A), the ribonuclease complex RNase P/MRP, mediated by the proteins like\nmethyladenosine RNA binding protein F2 (YTHDF2) and reactive intermediate\nimine deaminase A homolog (RIDA) [111].\n\nThe most documented role of circRNA is their function as sponge for miRNAs,\nalthough they have also been reported to act as sponges for RNA binding\nproteins. A specific class of intronic circRNAs retained in the nucleus can\nact as transcriptional regulators by interacting with U1 small nuclear\nribonucleoprotein (snRNP), RNAPol II, and the promoters of their parental\ngenes to enhance transcription. The importance of circRNA is especially\ncrucial in brain development and function, as they are notably enriched in\nbrain compared to other organs and a major fraction of circRNA derive from\ngenes expressed in neurons [112].\n\nAccumulating evidence demonstrated that circRNAs could encode functional\npolypeptides and are actively translated through mechanisms independent of\n5\u2032capping, such as those mediated by internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) or\nm6A modification [113, 114].

The properties of\nbreast milk, which cannot be replaced by any milk substitute mixture produced\nso far, are also crucial. In addition to its nutritional value, human milk\nalso plays a functional role [1], benefiting all systems and organs of the\ndynamically developing body of newborns and infants [2], and meeting all\nnutrient requirements up to the sixth month of a child\u2019s life [3,4,5]. A\nmother\u2019s own milk is the first choice for feeding premature babies [2,6,7].\nMoreover, breastfeeding also acts as a protective factor for mothers, reducing\nthe risk of developing breast cancer, ovarian cancer, type 2 diabetes, and\nhypertension [8,9,10]. Hence, a breastfeeding woman may face a fundamental\ndilemma when it comes to using contraceptives, as the choice and timing of\ncontraception can affect not only the breastfeeding process but also the\nbaby\u2019s development. Nonhormonal contraception methods are preferred for\nbreastfeeding women, with progestogen-only methods being another option.\nCombined hormonal contraceptive methods containing estrogen and progestogen\ncan be considered as a third contraceptive option during lactation [11,12].\nHowever, combined oral contraceptives should not be used in lactating mothers\nbefore 42 days postpartum, as the disadvantages of this method generally\noutweigh the benefits during the first 6 weeks to 6 months postpartum\n[13,14,15]. This is due to an increased risk of thromboembolic lesions and a\npotential decrease in milk supply during the first few days of estrogen\nexposure [16,17]. Additionally, there may be a risk of gynecomastia, mainly in\nmale newborns exposed to very high doses of ethinylestradiol [17,18,19].\nTherefore, the ideal contraception during lactation should not affect\nlactation (milk composition, milk volume) and offspring development. At the\nsame time, it should also be harmless and acceptable to partners, safe and\nreversible, simple to use, and should not limit the possibility of intercourse\nor affect libido. Consulting healthcare professionals for personalized\ncontraceptive recommendations adapted to each woman\u2019s clinical situation and\nindividual needs is essential. This study aims to analyze the literature on\nthe safety of progestogen hormonal contraceptive methods during lactation.\n\n2\\.

On the other hand,\ncadmium can profoundly disrupt glycogen metabolism (extensively reviewed in\n[215]), alter DNA methylation, and dysregulate gene expression, causing severe\nDNA damage and genotoxicity [220,224].\n\nCadmium toxicity has a significant impact on the kidneys, making them one of\nthe most affected organs [225]. Chronic exposure to cadmium, often through\ncontaminated food, can lead to renal dysfunction and damage. Over time,\ntubular cells accumulate the majority of cadmium absorbed through the\ngastrointestinal and respiratory systems, and its content in the kidneys is\ncorrelated with the quantity assimilated from external sources over an\nindividual\u2019s lifetime [226].\n\nAs comprehensively discussed by Hern\u00e1ndez-Cruz and coworkers, the key targets\nfor cadmium toxicity are mitochondria. The entry of cadmium into mitochondria\nresults in mitochondria dysfunction, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Cadmium\npromotes the generation of ROS by enhancing the activity of nicotinamide\nadenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) and reducing the\nactivity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase\n(CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). In addition, it increases the\nproduction of hydroxyl radicals (OH) by elevating free iron (Fe2+) levels.\nMoreover, cadmium impairs the function of tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)\nenzymes and causes damage to mitochondrial DNA [227]. It has been suggested\nthat the accumulation of cadmium in cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments\ninduces changes in the functioning of kidney proximal tubular epithelial\ncells. The initial impacts include oxidative stress, cell signaling cascade\ndisruption, and cell adhesion alterations. If the damage surpasses the\ncellular repair capacity, cell death occurs through apoptosis, necrosis, or a\ncombination of both. As epithelial cells align along the tubular basement\nmembrane via local adhesion molecules to collectively facilitate filtration\nand reabsorption, increased cell death in this area can result in dissociation\namong cells and the basement membrane. Consequently, these alterations in\nepithelial cells may lead to proteinuria, polyuria, and the progressive\ndeterioration of kidney function [228]. Finally, nephrotoxicity caused by\nprolonged exposure to elevated cadmium levels can progress to CKD, with\nprevalence rising worldwide [225].\n\nCadmium exhibits cytotoxic effects and can potentially act as a carcinogen\nwhen inhaled, while evidence for its carcinogenic activity through oral\ningestion is limited. Some studies have reported that long-term exposure to\ncadmium through the diet is associated with an increased risk of melanoma and\nprostate and gastric cancer [229,230,231].

Anterior Pituitary Cell Composition, Pituitary Hormones Involved in\nOvulation: LH, FSH, and PRL\n\nJoseph Lieutaud was the first anatomist (1703\u20131780) to recognize the portal\nsystem of the pituitary gland and to describe it in an anatomy book [103]. As\nmentioned above, the anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) derives from the\nstomodeum. It is composed of three parts: pars distalis, pars tuberalis, and\npars intermedia. In rats, on Ed 12, vessels from the capillary network of the\nhypothalamic surround Rathke\u2019s pouch [59,60].\n\nOver the past three decades, the number of articles and books dealing with the\nmolecular basis of pituitary vascularization and the development of the\npituitary cell composition has tremendously increased\n[104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111]. Signaling molecules and transcriptional\nfactors are involved in the differentiation of anterior pituitary cell\nlineages. In situ hybridization techniques and gene-modified (knockout,\nknockdown, and transgenic) animals were usually used. Zhao and co-workers\n[108] described the role of the LIM-homeobox gene (Lhx3) in the\ndifferentiation of Rathke\u2019s.\n\nTreier and co-workers [104] discussed three successive phases of signaling\nevents involved in the development of the pituitary gland in mice. The ventral\ndiencephalon, which expresses signal molecules (bone morphogenetic protein\n(BMP4), fibroblast growth factor protein (FGF) 8/10/18, and wingless protein\n(Wnt5)), directly contacts the oral ectoderm (which includes the hypophyseal\nplacod) and gives rise to Rathke\u2019s pouch. In the absence of BMP4, Rathke\u2019s\npouch formation occurs, but pituitary cell lineages fail to develop, except\nfor a few corticotropes (C). Sonic hedgehog protein (Shh) is expressed\nthroughout the oral ectoderm, except in Rathke\u2019s pouch, which creates a\nboundary between two ectodermal domains of Shh-expressing and Shh-non-\nexpressing cells. Opposing dorsal BMP4/FGF and ventral BMP2/Shh gradients\nmediate proliferative and positional signals by regulating combinatorial\npatterns of transcription factor gene expression. Pituitary-specific\ntranscription factor (Pit1) is induced on Ed 13.5 in the caudomedial region of\nthe pituitary gland of mice, which gives rise to somatotropes, lactotropes,\nand thyrotropes.

The combination of tract tracers (injected into the ME, intravenously\nor intraperitoneally) and immunohistochemistry allows the possibility to\ndemonstrate which GnRH neurons reach the capillary loops of the ME, i.e.,\nwhich neurons are hypophysiotropic [170,182]. Non-hypophysiotropic neurons\nplay a role in the regulation of other functions, such as sexual behavior\n[183]. The significance of the olfactory placode in the development of GnRH\nneurons was demonstrated by Saitoh and co-workers [184]. MBH of female rhesus\nmonkeys was lesioned. These animals became anovulatory. Then, a fetal\nolfactory placode was implanted into the infundibular recess of the third\nventricle. Two months later, the implantation of the olfactory placode\nresulted in resumption of the ovulatory cycle in a high percentage of the\nanimals.\n\nThe close developmental relation between the GnRH neurons and the terminal\nnerve suggests that there may also be a functional link between the two\nsystems. As it was mentioned above, the terminal nerve detects pheromones. The\npheromones are bioactive molecules that activate sensory neurons of VNO and\nmodify social and sexual behavior [185,186]. A naive animal responds\nbehaviorally to the presence of pheromones, without any prior experience or\nexposure, for example: a pup recognizes the source of milk, a male detects the\nother male and fights with him, and in some species, the estrus cycles can be\nsynchronized if beside the cage of females, another cage is placed containing\nmales. In spontaneously ovulating species (rodents and primates), which are\nthe main topic of this paper, the pheromones do not participate in the main\nstream of the molecular chain, which elaborates the ovulatory process.\nHowever, the pheromones influence the sexual and social behavior. It is an\ninteresting similarity between the GnRH and VNO neurons that pheromones in the\nsensory neurons of the VNO activate the phospholipase C pathway, as do the\nGnRH in the target cells [187].\n\n9\\. Pulsatility of GnRH\n\nThe hypophysiotropic GnRH neurons have a special appearance. Herde and co-\nworkers [188] described the morphology of GnRH neurons using a very elegant\nset of experiments. They demonstrated that the GnRH neurons are bipolar, with\ntwo long dendrite-like processes, one of which projects to the ME. The\nprocesses exhibit spines, indicating that these processes are not axons. In\nthe ME, the processes ramify, and the terminals show close contact with the\ncapillary loops. The GnRH processes do not express classical axonal or\ndendritic markers. These processes were named dendron. Immunohistochemical\nevidence shows that there are synaptic terminals along the projections, which\nmediate afferent inputs. Previously, this situation was shown by electron\nmicroscopy [189]. A special segment shows a typical action potential\ninitiation site. Researchers suggested that this unusual projection functions\nboth as an axon to conduct action potentials and as a dendrite receiving\nsynaptic input.\n\nIt became evident that the pulsatile discharge of GnRH is crucial for the\nnormal release of gonadotropins during ovulation. GnRH neurons secrete their\nhormones in rhythmic pulses. This property is an intrinsic ability of the GnRH\ncells, as it was demonstrated using the GT1 (immortalized mature mouse\nhypothalamic GnRH) neuronal cell line. In a super-fusion system, these cells\nreleased GnRH\n\n", "question": "What is the role of the terminal nerve?", "answer": "The terminal nerve detects pheromones, which are bioactive molecules that activate sensory neurons of VNO and modify social and sexual behavior."}

Classical models suggest a direct cellular regulation of the\nprocess [140], with integrin-collagen interactions potentially influencing it\n[141]. Conversely, an alternative phase-transition model proposes that the\nprotomers aggregate as a rapid self-assembly process because of their\nlongitudinal structure, mechanical loading, and geometric confinement in\nintercellular channels [142]. The involvement of integrins or other collagen-\ninteracting molecules in this process holds promise for potential novel\npharmacological interventions in the future.\n\nThe final structure of collagen fibers relies on interprotomeric covalent\nbonding to stabilize the fibers, facilitated by the enzymatic\ndeamination/oxidation of lysines. Members of the copper-dependent lysyl\noxidase family (LOX1, LOXL1, LOXL2, LOXL3, and LOXL4) orchestrate this redox\nprocess: initially, LOX oxidatively deaminates lysine or hydroxylysine\nresidues in collagen and elastin proteins, transforming them into allysine\nresidues. Subsequently, two allysine residues condense in a variety of aldol\ndimers [143], which seems to be the major stable cross-linking bond at both\nends of the type I collagen molecule in tissues that use the lysine aldehyde\npathway [144]. However, it has been contested [145]. Classically, it had been\nstated that allysine aldols further react to produce\nhistidinohydroxylysinonorleucine, which had been described as the main stable\nnatural maturation product [146]. Interestingly, LOX is secreted as a\nproenzyme that is activated by BMP1 and ADAMTS2/14 [147].\n\nThese targets have been the most extensively assayed. In December 2010, Gilead\nSciences acquired Arresto Biosciences for $225 million. Arresto Biosciences\nwas the owner of simtuzumab (AB0024), a humanized monoclonal antibody\ntargeting the human LOXL2. The antibody demonstrated efficacy in animal models\nof cancer and fibrosis [148]. Despite being subjected to 10 clinical trials\nand overall being well tolerated, its effectiveness remains elusive. Some of\nthe clinical trials on AB0024 were for conditions including idiopathic\npulmonary fibrosis [149], primary sclerosing cholangitis [150], primary\nmyelofibrosis or secondary to polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia\n[151], bridging fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis caused by nonalcoholic\nsteatohepatitis or cirrhosis due to non-alcoholic [152], liver fibrosis in\nHIV- and HCV-infected adults [153], steatohepatitis pancreatic adenocarcinoma\n(combined with gemcitabine) [154], or metastatic KRAS mutant colorectal cancer\n(combined with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan) [155], among\nothers.\n\nThe ineffectiveness of AB0024 could result from the intracellular functions of\nLOXL2, which are likely distinct from its lysyl oxidase activity [156].

Another example is plumbagin (9), a natural compound\nisolated from Plumbago zeylanica L. that selectively induces apoptosis in\nrefractory invasive prostate cancer cells (DU145) without affecting non-\ntumorigenic prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1).

One characteristic of MIBC is genomic instability caused by\ndysfunctional DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, including the NHEJ pathway\n[67]. In comparison to other, non-invasive BLCA species, Christin Richter et.\nal. reported that patients suffering from MIBC show high transcription factor\nE2F1 levels [67].\n\nHigh E2F1 levels transactivate factors associated not only with NHEJ but also\nwith MIR888, which indirectly represses APLF, upon hypo-methylation in\ninvasive BLCA species [67].

A deeper comprehension of these biological processes is\nexpected to yield novel insights and strategies for the prevention and\ntreatment of these age-related diseases (Figure 3).\n\nDuring immune senescence, all types of immune cell subsets, especially T\ncells, undergo substantial changes. These changes are marked by decreased T\ncell production, abnormal T cell metabolism, and imbalances in T subset ratios\ndue to thymic degeneration [91,95]. Thymic degeneration is critical in shaping\nthe balance of immune cells, particularly T cells [96,97,98]. The thymus\ncomprises two distinct tissue types: epithelial tissue devoid of thymopoiesis\nand non-epithelial perivascular space. With the aging of the thymus, the\ninterstitial epithelial layer increasingly disappears, and the perivascular\nlayer progressively fills the thymus. This transition results in a decrease in\nna\u00efve T cells, an increase in peripheral memory T cells, and a reduced\nlikelihood of newly generated T cells migrating to peripheral tissues\n[99,100,101].\n\nAn important hallmark of immunosenescence is the chronic, low-level\n\u201cinflammation\u201d throughout the body, characterized by elevated blood\ninflammatory markers, which is considered a central factor in the aging\nprocess [92,102]. This inflammation stems from the accumulation of damaged\nmacromolecules, while chronic tissue damage primarily arises from endogenous\ncellular debris [103]. Cellular senescence is at the heart of this\ninflammatory process.

Conversely, the suppression of RKIP expression\nusing small interfering RNA initiated the activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway.\nThe ectopic expression of RKIP altered HCC cell growth and migration, pointing\nto its role in human hepatocarcinogenesis. Intriguingly, Kim et al. discovered\nthat RKIP downregulation acts as a mechanism of sorafenib resistance in\nhepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, underscoring the significance of RKIP in\ntherapeutic resistance [60]. Additionally, Zhang Lin et al. demonstrated that\nRKIP functions as a tumor suppressor by influencing the biological\ncharacteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, suggesting potential\ntherapeutic applications [61]. A study revealed that miR-224 expression is\nelevated in breast cancer cell lines, particularly in highly invasive cells,\nand directly represses RKIP gene expression. This suggests that miR-224 plays\na crucial role in the metastasis of human breast cancer cells to the bone by\ndirectly inhibiting the tumor suppressor RKIP [62]. The overexpression of RKIP\nwas shown to deter cell growth and invasion in breast cancer cell lines by\nelevating miR-185, which targets and restrains HMGA2, a gene implicated in\ncancer metastasis. This study highlights the potential therapeutic value of\nsignaling pathway profiles including RKIP and miR-185 [63]. Research has shown\nthat RKIP expression is markedly reduced in pancreatic carcinoma tissues and\nis associated with patient outcomes. The overexpression of RKIP in pancreatic\nadenocarcinoma cells curbed cell proliferation and metastasis, and\ndownregulated the Raf-1-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, indicating its\npotential as a therapeutic target for anti-metastatic strategies in pancreatic\ncancer [64].\n\nRecently, Park and his colleagues have studied the relationship between Merlin\nand RKIP, suggesting that there are specific interactions that may influence\ntumor behavior and therapeutic responses: They found that Merlin blocks Snail-\nmediated p53 suppression and it is stabilized by RKIP, suggesting a\ncooperative role in blocking p53 inhibition in mesothelioma [65]. And then,\nthey reported that the loss of the NF2 gene induces non-canonical and\noncogenic TGF\u03b2 signaling mediated by TGF\u03b2 receptor1, leading to the\nphosphorylation and degradation of RKIP. This mechanism results in MAPK\nactivation and oncogenic signaling in NF2-deficient cells. Furthermore, it was\nsuggested that blocking the kinase activity of TGF\u03b2 receptor 1 could\npotentially restore cell differentiation and suppress growth in NF2-related\nconditions [24]. Finally, they highlighted that a selective RKIP inducer (a\nnovel chemical called Nf18001), which does not block the kinase activity of\nTGF\u03b2 receptor 1, can inhibit tumor growth and promote schwannoma cell\ndifferentiation under NF2-deficient conditions. This report involves reducing\nSOX2 expression and increasing SOX10 expression through Nf18001 [25]. These\nfindings indicate a protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) between Merlin and RKIP,\nprimarily influencing tumor growth, signaling pathways, and gene regulation,\nwhich could inform future therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.\n\n6\\.

SKM contractile activity promotes increased intra-tumoral\nblood flow and oxygen level, thus interfering with intra-tumoral hypoxia\n[119,146] and consequently limiting tumor progression by interrupting energy\nmetabolism.\n\n3.3.4. Oxidative Stress\n\nROS produced by increased SKM contractile activity may induce oxidative stress\nin tumor cells that have infiltrated SKM. Although ROS can be pro-tumorigenic,\nexcess ROS results in oxidative stress, which interferes with the balance of\noxidation and reduction and impairs tumor cell proliferation [147].\n\n3.3.5.

Although SKM-specific BDNF expression (both\nmRNA and protein) increases with exercise in mice [202] and humans, post-\nexercise plasma levels in humans remain unchanged [203]. This suggests that\nBDNF in SKM may act in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Evidence that BDNF\nexerts anti-tumorigenic activity includes the following: First, infusion of\nBDNF into a glioma-bearing mouse brain suppressed tumor growth and migration\nvia a truncated TrkB.T1 receptor-dependent mechanism; it also suppressed\nintra-tumoral macrophage infiltration [204]. Second, hypothalamic BDNF\noverexpression in mice increased the number of CD8+ T-lymphocytes; this\nincrease was essential for the anti-tumorigenic effect in an orthotropic model\nof melanoma [205]. Finally, hypothalamic BDNF overexpression in mice decreased\nmelanoma tumor weight by about 80%, whereas blockade of hypothalamic BDNF\nexpression via RNA interference mitigated the anti-tumorigenic intervention of\nenvironmental enrichment, which included a voluntary running wheel; this\nsuggests that BDNF was responsible for the anti-tumorigenic effect [206].\nAccordingly, SKM muscle-derived BDNF may act locally to inhibit tumor growth.\n\n3.4.6. Interleukin-6\n\nIL-6 was the first myokine discovered [153] and is perhaps the most studied.\nThe source of IL-6 appears to be important, with post-exercise increases in\nIL-6 exhibiting multiple anti-tumorigenic effects [78,207,208]. SKM is a\nprimary source of exercise-induced increases in IL-6, although it has a short\nclearance rate [209]. Substantial evidence supports the anti-tumorigenic\npotential of SKM-derived IL-6, including its role in the SKM contractile\nactivity-induced mitigation of cancer risk. For instance, anti-IL-6 antibodies\nat least partly eliminated the exercise-induced tumor suppression observed in\nmice [161]. Moreover, IL-6 inhibited proliferation of prostate cancer cells\n[210], colorectal cancer cells [211], and mammary cancer cells [212]; however,\ntreatment protocols can alter the results [130]. In mammary cancer cells, IL-6\ndecreased proliferation via regulation of matrix metalloproteinases [212],\nthus IL-6 may directly regulate the tumor microenvironment; it also exhibits\nanti-tumorigenicity by increasing natural killer cell activity and intra-\ntumoral infiltration; these lymphocyte-mediated responses are necessary, but\nnot sufficient, for anti-tumorigenicity [161], suggesting that other exercise-\nrelated humoral or additional factors are also involved.\n\n3.4.7.

The visualization of these structures is\npossible due to the small thickness of the specimens (tens of \u00b5m to sub-10\n\u00b5m), with an ideal lateral resolution for an optical microscope being a\nminimum of 200 nm, with an axial resolution of 500 nm [91].

To highlight specific cellular\norganelles (within the resolution limits imposed by the technique/equipment),\nspecific stains or an antigen-antibody-based labeling system are used, where\nthe antigen is represented by specific molecules from cellular substructures.\nThis procedure, applied to isolated cells, is called immunocytochemistry and\ninvolves marking certain proteins of interest with a primary antibody against\nthe respective protein (e.g., anti-tubulin antibody that specifically reacts\nwith tubulin in the cellular cytoskeleton). Subsequently, a secondary antibody\nis used against the primary antibody, conjugated with an enzymatic label that\ncatalyzes a color reaction in the substrate (e.g., the primary antibody is\nderived from a mouse, so the secondary antibody must come from another animal,\nand it must also specifically react with primary mouse antibodies).\n\nVisualization of nanoparticles in optical microscopy is not possible if they\ndo not have adequate concentrations and do not aggregate in the intracellular\nenvironment, so these clusters exceed the resolution limit.

In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB.

Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment.

DCA Enters the Oncology Terrain\n\nIn 2007, a group headed by Drs. Bonnet and Michelakis [71] called attention to\nDCA\u2019s putative usefulness in cancer. They studied three highly glycolytic cell\nlines: glioblastoma (MO59K), lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and breast cancer\ncells (MCF7). The three cell types had a hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane\npotential (\u0394\u03a8m) that was reversed to normal by an incubation with DCA in a\ndose-dependent manner. DCA also increased voltage-gated potassium channel\n(Kv1.5) expression, which was decreased in the malignant cells. The\ncombination of a hyperpolarized \u0394\u03a8m and low expression of Kv1.5 is a\nconsequence of high glycolytic flux and metabolism and induces resistance to\napoptosis. They found that DCA induced apoptosis and decreased proliferation\nby restoring mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, without toxicity to normal\ncells (Figure 1).\n\nSince then, many clinics, usually called \u201cDCA Clinics\u201d, have opened, mainly in\nCanada and Germany. These clinics provide other naturopathic treatments for\ncancer, but the main therapy given is based on DCA. However, due to the lack\nof FDA approval, DCA has not entered mainstream oncological practice. Although\nDCA use was born as an alternative cancer treatment, unfortunately its real\nbenefits in cancer are still unproven, although there is much evidence that\nsupports the need for more testing. The fact that in many cases it has been\nco-opted by medically unqualified people raises doubts as to if it will ever\nbe validated or accepted as an effective cancer treatment (Figure 2).\n\n1.2.3. Chemistry and Pharmacology of DCA\n\nDCA is an investigational drug used to treat lactic acidosis, pulmonary\nhypertension, familial hyperlipidemia, and, more recently, cancer. Its use is\nunofficially accepted for the treatment of lactic acidosis in children with\nmalaria in some African countries [73].\n\nHumans are exposed to small amounts of DCA through drinking water. Chlorinated\nacetic acids, including DCA, are formed from organic material during water\nchlorination [74]. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, DCA\nconcentrations in drinking water range from 1 to 99 \u00b5g/L.\n\nThe structure of DCA is shown in Figure 3. It is a small molecule and an\norganochlorine compound of acetic acid that is sometimes sold as a sodium\nsalt.\n\nDCA is an orally available molecule that is quickly and almost completely\nabsorbed by the digestive system [77]. It is initially distributed to the\nliver and muscles, and afterwards to other tissues [78]. DCA is metabolized by\nGSTZ1 (a glutathione transferase isoform) [79] (Figure 3).

In\nanother study, Brandsma et al. [405] describe a case of severe encephalopathy\ndue to DCA in a 46-year-old male patient with melanoma treated with 15\nmg/kg/day.\n\nThe incidence of polyneuropathy in children with mitochondrial disease\nreceiving 12.5 mg/kg twice a day is 10% [406], and in adults, it reaches to\n86%.\n\nThe mechanism producing neuropathy has not been fully elucidated. It is known\nthat DCA can produce dose-dependent demyelination through the reversible\ninhibition of myelin-related proteins [407]. Based on some evidence, we\nspeculate that DCA-induced inhibition of glycolysis is the cause, and studies\nhave shown that glycolysis is required by myelinating Schwann cells\n[408,409,410,411]. In theory, it may be possible to reduce DCA\u2019s neurotoxicity\nby administering antioxidants [412] because oxidative stress is also one of\nDCA\u2019s effects. However, this requires experimental confirmation. Importantly,\nperipheral neuropathy is a reversible phenomenon that improves after a few\ndays of drug wash out. As noted above (Section 1.2.3), glutathione transferase\nzeta 1 (GSTZ1) is important in the metabolism of DCA and polymorphisms of the\nGSTZ1 gene in humans may enhance DCA toxicity [413].\n\nOther side effects of DCA may be related to unintentional cell death. DCA\ntreatment affects predominantly cancer cells, but non-cancer cells may also be\naffected, although in a less significant way [414]. However, at high doses,\ncellular damage is probably not restricted to cancer cells. There is also a\nreport of DCA induction of liver carcinogenesis and lipoperoxidation in rats\nand mice [415,416]. Here, the doses of DCA in drinking water were up to 2 g/L,\nwhich are much higher than others have used, and oral administration was up to\n100 mg/kg doses.\n\nThere is a fatal case report of bone marrow and liver toxicity with the\nartesunate\u2013DCA association in a patient with glioblastoma [417]. In this case,\nan unknown amount of DCA was given by an alternative practitioner, and so a\nvery high dose may have been administered.

However,\nthese studies have used up to 2 g/L in drinking water or 300 mg/kg acutely and\nthe high doses may account for some of their results. In some cases, the\nresults also may be due to the co-administration of trichloroacetic acid with\nDCA.\n\n8\\.

We were able to\nconfirm this potential by showing a significant upregulation of E-cadherin at\nboth mRNA and protein levels after treatment with MPK544. Furthermore, MPK544\nshowed a concentration-dependent effect that was superior to SAHA at a\nconcentration of 1 \u00b5M after 24 h. Furthermore, in co-culture spheroids,\ntreatment with MPK544 led to a significant increase in E-cadherin expression.\nIn contrast, tubastatin A did not induce a significant increase in E-cadherin\nexpression in 2D and 3D models, confirming the hypothesis that HDAC 6 is not\ninvolved in the regulation of E-cadherin expression. A key activator of the\nEMT is the effector cytokine TGF-\u03b2 which leads to the increased invasion of\ntumor cells through the downregulation of the epithelial marker E-cadherin\n[36,52]. Krau\u00df et al. (2022) were able to show that HDAC 2 deactivates the\ntumor suppressor pathways of TGF-\u03b2 in PDAC [38]. TGF-\u03b2 is known to be a potent\ninducer of the EMT and chemoresistance in PDAC. The most aggressive form of\nPDAC is classified as a basal-like PDAC which exhibits a TGF-\u03b2 signature and\nis enriched in the EMT. Therefore, we investigated whether MPK544 could\nreverse the TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT. MPK544 was able to reverse the TGF-\u03b2-induced\nEMT in PANC-1 cells, indicated by the significant upregulation of E-cadherin\nat the mRNA and protein level. These results are consistent with the findings\nof Mishra et al. (2017b) showing that the specific class I HDACis domatinostat\n(4SC-202), entinostat, and mocetinostat were able to reverse the TGF-\u03b2-induced\nEMT [49].\n\nE-cadherin is a calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecule responsible for cell\ncontraction in epithelial tissues. The upregulation of E-cadherin has been\nshown to be associated with a reduced metastasis rate and invasion of\npancreatic cancer cells mediated by the inhibition of HDAC 2. To investigate\nthe invasion capacity, we established a spherical invasion assay adopted from\nHurley et al. (2017) [37]. MPK544 treatment significantly reduced the invasive\npotential of PANC-1 cells. However, recent studies have revealed that partial\nEMT (p-EMT) enables the metastasis of circulating tumor cells and is\nassociated with shorter progression-free survival [53,54]. p-EMT may be\nregulated independently of TGF-\u03b2 and is therefore fundamentally different from\nthe classical EMT process. In contrast to fully mesenchymal cells, which\nmigrate as individual cells, cells in the p-EMT state migrate in clusters\nthrough the vasculature. In future studies, the mechanism by which HDACs\nregulate p-EMT in PDAC needs to be further investigated.\n\nHDAC inhibition has been shown to affect the cell cycle and induce apoptosis\nin cancer cells [55]. Our results showed that the inhibition of HDAC 2/6 by\nMPK544 resulted in a significant induction of apoptosis and cell cycle shift\nin the G2/M phase. In agreement with the results of Wang et al. (2012),\ntreatment with the HDAC 6-specific inhibitor tubastatin A showed minimal\neffects on the cell cycle and the induction of apoptosis [50]. These results\nsupport the findings of Krau\u00df et al. (2022) who showed that the depletion of\nHDAC 2 led to cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in murine PDAC [38].

These micelles feature a well-\ndefined nucleus\u2013crown structure, with poly(propylene lactone) (PLA) chain\nsegments serving as the core material due to their exceptional\nbiocompatibility and biodegradability. They are connected to methoxy\npoly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) at one end and poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) at the\nother end through disulfide bonds. To ensure prolonged blood circulation and\nexcellent stability under physiological conditions (pH 7.4), the micelles\nconceal their positive charge via the amination of PEI.

However, the therapeutic\neffects of these treatments exhibit significant variability among individuals\nand tumor types, thereby highlighting the existing disparity in gene mutation\nabundance and heterogeneity of the immune microenvironment [4, 5]. Hence, it\nis imperative to clarify the molecular pathogenesis and immune composition of\ntumors and conduct analytical validation of universal biomarkers.\n\nThe tumor microenvironment (TME) pertains to the internal surroundings that\nimpact the progression and survival of tumor cells [6]. Cells synthesize and\nrelease a network of macromolecules, known as the extracellular matrix (ECM).\nTumor cells, immune cells, stromal cells, and ECM components make up the TME\n[7]. The deposition and remodeling of ECM serve as the primary step and\nbiochemical foundation for tumor malignant behaviors and immune cell\ninfiltration [4, 8]. The roles of cellular senescence in tumor cell behaviors\nare controversial, senescent cells block tumor growth while maintaining a\nmetabolically active state. Despite slowing down tumor progression, cellular\nsenescence encourages metastasis, alters the TME, and affects treatment\noutcomes [9]. The innate immune system interacts with tumors in TME and plays\na dual role in abnormal cellular senescence and elimination. This process\ninvolves the participation of CD4 + T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and\nnatural killer cells [10]. Therefore, it is necessary to find key molecules\nco-regulating immunity, senescent tumor cell and ECM.\n\nLysyl oxidase-like-2 (LOXL2), a copper-dependent amine oxidase, is a member of\nthe LOX family [11]. A major role of LOXL2 is to facilitate and stabilize the\ncross-linking process of elastin and collagen within the ECM. Additionally,\nLOXL2 has been mainly researched in individual tumors, including breast cancer\n[12], hepatocellular carcinoma [13], non-small cell lung cancer [14], cervical\ncancer [15], colon cancer [16], and esophageal cancer [17], and several\nstudies have found its association with tumor progression, metastasis, chemo-\nradiotherapy resistance, and worse prognosis [18\u201321]. However, progress\ntowards humanized LOXL2 targeted drugs is not as expected [22, 23]. During\nreplicative and stress-induced senescence, fibroblasts and epithelial cells\nexhibited elevated levels of LOXL2 expression, whereas its occurrence in\noncogene-induced cellular senescence was rarely reported [24, 25]. Besides,\nthe pathological effects and function of LOXL2 are underrecognized,\n\n", "question": "What is the role of LOXL2 in the tumor microenvironment?", "answer": "LOXL2 facilitates and stabilizes the cross-linking process of elastin and collagen within the ECM and has been associated with tumor progression, metastasis, chemo-radiotherapy resistance, and worse prognosis in several types of cancer, including breast cancer."}

{"id": "PMC11208921-3", "context": "showed a significant correlation (p = 0.04) with a ROC area 0.79).\n\nNext, we used DepMap to further test whether the GS correlates with MCL1\ndependence in TNBC cell lines. For this purpose, we downloaded MCL1 CRISPR\ndependency scores (DepMap Public 23Q2+Score, Chronos) from the Depmap portal,\nwhich included a total of 13 TNBC cell lines in the MCL1 CRISPR panel. Based\non their dependence scores, we categorized these cell lines into less\ndependent (green) and more dependent (yellow) groups (Fig. 3D). Subsequently,\nwe calculated the GS scores for each cell line as described above and\nperformed ROC curve analysis to assess the correlation between the GS scores\nand MCL1 dependence. The results demonstrated a significant correlation\nbetween the GS scores and MCL1 dependence, with an ROC area of 0.786 (p =\n0.04) (Fig. 3E). Thus, by cross-referencing in-house experiments, the GDSC\ndatabase, the CCLE RNAseq database, and the DepMap database, we identified a\nnovel GS that predicts MCL1 inhibitor sensitivity and MCL1 dependence in TNBC\ncell lines.\n\nWe hypothesized high expression of the four GS factors may promote signaling\npathways that increase MCL1 inhibitor resistance. AXL is a receptor tyrosine\nkinase that interacts with Gas6, activating several signaling pathways,\nincluding PI3K/AKT/mTOR, JAK/STAT, NF-\u03baB, and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (9). IL6\n(interleukin 6) is highly expressed in TNBC and promotes JAK/STAT and ERK\nsignaling (10, 11, 12). EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix\nprotein 1 (EFEMP1) binds to EGFR, triggering EGFR autophosphorylation and\nactivating downstream MAPK and AKT pathways (13). ETS1 is a transcription\nfactor that is activated by ERK and highly expressed in TNBC tumors (14, 15).\nImmunoblotting showed phospho-JAK3 (Y980/981), phospho-STAT3 (Y705), and\nphospho-ERK (T202/Y204) proteins, but not phospho-AKT (S473), are higher in\nresistant versus sensitive cell lines (Fig. 4A), suggesting resistant lines\nhave hyper-activated JAK/STAT and RAS/ERK pathways that could contribute to\nMCL1 inhibitor resistance. Inhibition of AXL with a specific inhibitor BGB324\n(currently in clinical trial for AML) downregulated phospho-JAK3, phospho-\nSTAT3, and phospho-ERK in HS578T and MDA231 cells (Fig. 4B), indicating AXL\nactivates JAK/STAT and MEK/ERK pathways in these cells. Notably, BGB324 did\nnot affect MCL1 levels (Fig. 4B). Moreover, BGB324 significantly increased the\npercentage of sub-G1 cells in MCL1 inhibitor (S63845)-treated HS578T and\nMDA231 cells but did not in S63845-treated BT20 and MDA468 cells (Fig. 4, C\nand D). These findings support the notion that high AXL expression promotes\nMCL1 inhibitor resistance in these cells.Figure 4\n\nMCL1 inhibitor-resistant cells have hyper-activation of AXL-JAK/STAT and ERK\npathways.

Cellular apoptosis and the reduction in tumour size were\nevidenced after injections of BoNT into malignant tumour models associated\nwith antiproliferative effects and increased caspase 3/7 activity\n[122,123,124]. Yet, the BoNT dose and exposure durations used in experimental\nstudies are not directly transferable to the dosing regimen applied in human\npatients. Progress is being made to deliver BoNT to cells selectively (breast\ncancer cells in vitro) since early data suggest that the BoNT/A apoptotic\nactivity may be selective for cancer cells, but additional studies are still\nrequired to assess the translational value of experimental in vivo or in vitro\nfindings to human patients [125].\n\nTo summarise clinical and experimental findings, there is serious suggestion\nthat BoNT can help cancer patients suffering from acute or chronic pain. Since\nthe very origin of the pain comes from the muscle, from the neuropathic injury\nor the inflammation due to peripheral nerve entrapment, BoNT can bring an\nincredible benefit to the patient acting on each pathophysiological process.\nBotulinum toxin treatment offers two major benefits over classical pain\nremedies: BoNT injection effects last from 3 to 6 months and BoNTs are\nlocalised and safer than all potent analgesic agents. All the clinical studies\nperformed recently in cancer patients after a surgery or a radiation therapy\nconfirm the efficacy and safety of BoNTs on the pain associated with surgical\nand radiation therapies. BoNT is also very helpful in orofacial pain induced\nby chemotherapy.\n\nNevertheless, safety studies are required to guarantee safe dosing. Indeed,\nlast year, a botulism outbreak occurred in Turkey following the injection of\nexcessive BoNT doses in the stomach of patients [126]. Nevertheless, the\npotential benefit of BoNT is very promising because of the increasing\nincidence of cancer.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that only two BoNT toxinotypes are currently\napproved for clinical use (BoNT/A and BoNT/B) despite the existence of at\nleast eight different toxinotypes, BoNT A to H (or mosaic FA), thus suggesting\na wider therapeutic potential [29]. Considering the increasing interest in\ntherapeutic applications of BoNTs, it is becoming very attractive to enhance\nthe properties of BoNTs by modulating its potency, eliminating its\nimmunogenicity, extending the effects duration, developing fast acting\nformulations, or retargeting the toxin towards sensory neurons. Extending the\nduration of action of BoNT would benefit patients suffering from chronic\nconditions like muscle spasticity, overactive bladder or chronic migraine. The\nfast-acting formulations would be beneficial to deal with acute pain and also\nto expand the cosmetic uses.\n\n4\\.

Tregs exhibited the highest change in\napoptosis at 4 h post-NPT. Activated Tregs, in particular, exhibited a 53.7%\nincrease in apoptosis (Figure 4D), whereas CD8 T cells showed no change and\nCD4 Tconv had a small but insignificant increase in apoptotic death.\n\n3.5. NPT Reduces Treg Suppression Capacity\n\nIn vitro Treg suppression assays were conducted to assess if NPT alters the\nTreg suppression function. Tregs were isolated and incubated with CFSE-labeled\nCD8 T cells at different Treg/CD8 ratios in the presence of activation beads.\nTregs isolated from dLNs of NP-treated mice exhibited a 50.5% reduced\nsuppression capacity compared to those from untreated tumors (control group)\nat a 1:1 Treg/CD8 co-culture ratio (Figure 5A). To further explore why the\nTreg function was impaired, we next examined if various activation markers\nwere altered by NPT. As seen in Figure 5B, the activated (CD44+CD62L\u2212) Tregs\nwere the initially dominant Treg population in the dLN of tumor-bearing mice.\nThese activated Tregs outnumbered na\u00efve Tregs at a 2:1 ratio. Following NPT,\nthe activated/na\u00efve (CD44\u2212CD62L+) Treg ratio shifted to 1:1 by Day 1, and\nna\u00efve Tregs became the dominant Treg population by post-treatment Day 3, at an\nactivated/na\u00efve Treg ratio of 1:2 (Figure 5B,D).\n\nThe T cell activation marker 4-1BB, which has significant immunotherapeutic\npotential, was expressed among Tregs in the dLN (Figure 5C,E), tumors\n(Supplementary Figure S4), and spleens (Figure 5F) of tumor-bearing mice.\nHowever, 4-1BB expression was not found among (a) Tregs in the blood, (b)\nTregs in any healthy (na\u00efve) mouse tissues (Supplementary Figure S5, negative\ncontrol), or (c) in conventional CD4 (Supplementary Figure S5) or CD8 T cells\nof healthy or tumor-bearing mice.

Interestingly, there was an early\ntransient peak among 4-1BB+ Tregs, around a two-fold increase from baseline,\nby 4 h post-NPT in the dLN, followed by a seven-fold drop by 24 h post-\ntreatment (Figure 5C,E).\n\nThe 4-1BB+ Tregs were exclusively present among activated Tregs, and they were\nmostly absent among na\u00efve Tregs in the dLN of tumor-bearing mice\n(Supplementary Figure S6A).

Sorafenib was reported\nto significantly increase the peripheral recruitment and intratumoral\ninfiltration of macrophages in metastatic liver cancer, accompanied by an\nelevation of SDF-1\u03b1, CSF-1, and VEGF in the tumor stroma [54]. In the hypoxic\nniches induced by sorafenib, TAMs promote the expression of galectin-3, and\nthis further induces TAM infiltration [77]. Furthermore, the TAM-mediated\npromotion of tumor growth and metastasis in hypoxia was inhibited by the\nadministration of a macrophage-depletion agent or galectin-3 inhibitor in a\nmammary model [77]. The depletion of macrophages by zoledronic acid and\nclodrolip in combination with sorafenib may significantly suppress tumor\nangiogenesis and distant organ metastasis, demonstrating the role of TAMs in\ntumor development in sorafenib therapy [54]. Sorafenib also mediated the\ninfiltration of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) in hepatocellular\ncarcinoma patients and animal models, while TANs further promoted more\nintratumoral macrophages and T-regulatory (Treg) cells through secreting CCL2\nand CCL17 [76]. The injection of neutralizing antibodies against CCL12 and\nCCL17 into tumors caused an explicit reduction in tumor size and pulmonary\nmetastasis, with a drop in the migratory activities of TAMs and Treg cells\n[76]. Additionally, sunitinib and bevacizumab treatments simultaneously\ninhibited the infiltration of macrophages and enhanced overall survival\ncompared with bevacizumab therapy alone. However, gliomas developed a\nmesenchymal phenotype and expressed stem cell markers at the late tumor of\ntumor progression [74].\n\nPolarization of TAMs to M2-like phenotype\n\nMacrophages show remarkable plasticity in response to microenvironmental cues\n[78]. An alteration in macrophage polarization in the TME to an immune-\nsuppressive phenotype was always reported after chemotherapy or vascular\ntargeted therapy [75, 79, 80].\n\nUnlike chemotherapy-induced recruitment of TAMs that is primarily dependent on\nvarious chemokines, chemotherapy-induced polarization of TAMs to the M2\nphenotype has more diverse mechanisms. The experimental results suggest that\nprostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and IL-6 increased in cervical and ovarian cancer cell\nlines treated with carboplatin or cisplatin. These two inflammatory mediators\npromoted the polarization of macrophages to M2 subtype, while blocking the\ntypical NF-\u03baB signaling pathway could inhibit the impact of chemotherapy and\nprevent the production of PGE2 and IL-6 in tumor cell lines. Meanwhile, the\nenhancement of M2 phenotypic polarization by chemotherapy disappeared. These\nphenomena suggest that chemotherapy depends on two inflammatory mediators,\nPGE2 and IL-6, to promote M2-type polarization [81]. Additionally, paclitaxel\ntreatment of breast cancer mice causes a large accumulation of reactive oxygen\nspecies (ROS) at the tumor site, which stimulates the secretion of cytokines\nsuch as IL-10, IL-4, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3),\nand CXCL1 and promotes the transformation of macrophages to the\nimmunosuppressive phenotype [82].

Stable SIRT1 expression contributes to epithelial integrity by\nupregulating E-cadherin expression, thus mitigating the risk of invasion and\nmetastasis in oral cancer (103, 104). These findings suggest a tumor-\nsuppressive role for SIRT1 in oral cancer. However, conflicting evidence\nexists, with some studies highlighting SIRT1\u2019s tumor-promoting aspects. For\ninstance, SIRT1 overexpression has been linked to cisplatin resistance in oral\ncancer via the upregulation of annexin A4 (105, 106). Similarly, the\ninvolvement of SIRT3 in oral cancer has been scrutinized. SIRT3 is vital for\nregulating cellular ROS levels, exerting anti-tumor effects in oral cancer\ncells by managing ROS and diminishing its activity. The absence of SIRT3 leads\nto increased ROS, which escalates genomic instability and fosters\ntumorigenesis (107\u2013109). Furthermore, SIRT7 has been identified as a\nmetastasis inhibitor in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), where its\ndownregulation promotes invasion and migration of OSCC cells, whereas its\noverexpression hampers metastasis through the negative regulation of\nepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (110\u2013112).\n\n7.2Breast cancer insights\n\nSIRT7 has emerged as a critical modulator of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2\n(TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathway and an antagonist of breast cancer metastasis. It is\nmarkedly reduced in lung metastases from breast cancer in both humans and\nmice, indicating that a deficiency in SIRT7 propels the metastasis of breast\ncancer cells.

An increasing number of studies\nhave demonstrated that circRNAs have multiple important biological functions\n12. Structurally, circRNAs possess MREs, which act as a miRNA sponge by\nadsorbing different specific miRNAs to regulate the expression of downstream\ntargets via complementary base pairing 13. In addition, circRNAs can interact\nwith other types of RNAs or proteins to regulate gene expression at the\ntranscriptional and posttranscriptional levels; and a small portion of\ncircRNAs even have protein translation functions 14, 15.\n\nFunctioning as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) is the main mechanism by\nwhich circRNAs regulate gene expression 16. The term ceRNA refers to\ncompetitive binding of miRNAs to endogenous RNA molecules with the same MREs\nto regulate each other's expression levels 17. CircRNAs are rich in MREs,\nwhich can act as miRNA sponges to adsorb specific miRNAs and prevent miRNAs\nfrom binding to downstream RNA targets in a complementary base pairing manner,\nthus regulating the expression levels of target genes 18.\n\nRecent studies have revealed that circRNAs interact with disease-related\nmiRNAs and participate in the occurrence and development of GC through the\nceRNA network, which is closely related to patient prognosis. Abnormally high\nlevels of hsa_circ_0092306 in GC tissue allow hsa_circ_0092306 to act as a\nmiRNA sponge to adsorb miR-197-3p and prevent miR-197-3p from binding to its\ndownstream target oncogene PRKCB, which ultimately inhibits cell apoptosis and\npromotes cancer cell migration and invasion 19. The expression level of\nhsa_circ_0092306 in GC is positively correlated with patient tumor size,\nhistological grade, TNM stage, and lymph node metastasis 19. In another study,\nLiang et al. reported that low expression of circRAB31 in GC is closely\nassociated with multiple prognostic factors, such as tumor size, cell\ndifferentiation, and lymph node metastasis 20. Mechanistic research further\nrevealed that circRAB31 acts as a miR-885-5p sponge to indirectly downregulate\nthe expression of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, inhibit the PI3K/AKT pathway\nby regulating AKT phosphorylation, and promote the proliferation, migration,\nand invasion of GC cells 20. Moreover, in the field of GC, more circRNAs, such\nas circREPS2, circEVI5, circCYFIP2, and hsa_circ_0000199, have been shown to\nindirectly regulate the expression levels of target genes and alter the\nbiological behavior of GC cells by adsorbing their specific miRNAs through a\nceRNA mechanism 21-24. Therefore, functioning as ceRNAs is an important\nmechanism by which circRNAs regulate gene expression, and the study of related\nceRNAs will provide new ideas for combatting the pathogenesis of GC.\n\nIn this study, we found that hsa_circ_0005927 was downregulated only in HGIEN\ntissues and GC tissues during gastric carcinogenesis (Fig. 1D), which\nindicates that its expression is strongly correlated with GC.\nClinicopathological factor analysis suggested that\n\n", "question": "How do circRNAs regulate gene expression?", "answer": "CircRNAs regulate gene expression by functioning as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) that adsorb specific miRNAs and prevent them from binding to downstream RNA targets, thus regulating the expression levels of target genes."}

There are few studies on this topic, and the current\npractice is to reduce irradiation to the contralateral implant or increase\ncoverage of the IMN by moving the contralateral implant away from the\ntreatment area or reducing the volume of the tissue expander [47, 48, 49].\n\nPMRT has undergone a transition from two\u2010dimensional conventional and\nthree\u2010dimensional conformal techniques to newer techniques, such as\nintensity\u2010modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy\n(VMAT), and proton radiation therapy [50, 51]. These three techniques have\nbeen shown to improve the quality of radiotherapy plans for patients\nundergoing BR [52, 53]. Compared with three\u2010dimensional conformal radiation\ntherapy, IMRT and VMAT can deliver different doses to different target areas\nof the chest wall and lymph nodes, which can improve the uniformity of dose\ndistribution in the target area and avoid high doses to the heart and lungs\n[54, 55]. VMAT has been shown to significantly reduce doses to the lung,\nheart, and contralateral breast/implant in patients with left\u2010sided breast\ncancer when combined with deep inspiration breath\u2010hold [56, 57]. However,\nbreast radiotherapy with IMRT or VMAT increases exposure to large low\u2010dose\nareas (\u22645 Gy) in the chest, which may increase the incidence of\nradiation\u2010related secondary tumors [58]. Further studies are required to\ndetermine the long\u2010term complications of IMRT and VMAT. Compared with photon\ntherapy, proton therapy, as a result of its unique physical and biological\nproperties, can significantly reduce the radiation dose to normal tissues\naround the tumor, such as the heart and lungs, without reducing the dose to\nthe tumor. Lower radiation doses to the heart and lungs are associated with\nlower risks of late cardiac events and secondary primary tumors [59, 60, 61,\n62]. Furthermore, proton therapy can be used to reduce the dose to surrounding\nnormal tissue and avoid poor clinical target coverage in patients with IMN\nirradiation or left\u2010sided breast cancer [63, 64, 65].\n\nDifferent radiation modalities, fractionations, and the use of a local boost\nor bolus may be crucial determinants of the ultimate cosmetic result in women\nundergoing BR.

Initially described by Takahashi et al. in the 1980s, it is\nlocated on chromosome 10q11.2 [4,8] and plays a crucial role in development of\nthe genitourinary tract and nervous system [9,10,11] as a functional receptor\nfor glial cell-derived neurotrophic factors (GDNFs).\n\nIn absence of ligand binding, the RET TKR exists as a single unphosphorylated\nTKR. With ligand binding, it undergoes dimerization and phosphorylation to\nactivate several intracellular signalling pathways, including the p38 mitogen-\nactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, the phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase\n(PI3K) pathway and the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway,\nwhich result in cellular proliferation [13]. Pathogenic variants cause\nconstitutional activation and therefore drive downstream pathways independent\nof ligand binding to the extracellular domain.\n\nThe mechanism of oncogenic activation differs depending on the region of the\nRET TKR that is abnormal. Variants in the extracellular domain trigger ligand-\nindependent dimerization and autophosphorylation, which in turn activate\ndownstream intracellular signalling pathways. In comparison, if the variant\noccurs in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, autophosphorylation occurs\nwithout dimerization, which may drive activation of additional downstream\npathways that are not typically controlled by the RET TKR when activated\nthrough the extracellular domain [14]. In RET fusion events, the transmembrane\ndomain is absent and the kinase domain is constituently active [12].\n\nSeveral distinct activating RET single nucleotide variants, with corollary\nphenotypic patterns [1], drive the majority of MTC cases; although, RET\nappears to be the only germline driver gene mutation recurrently involved in\nMTC [15].

Given that BCCT.core is the only established modality for\nevaluating aesthetic outcomes in postoperative breast cancer patients, it has\nbeen widely adopted in research, including recent prospective trials1\u20133. While\ndevelopers proposed adopting 3D images for future versions, no clear benefit\nwas outlined4. However, its reliability is in question due to discrepancies\nbetween patient self-assessments (69.2% to 74.8%) and clinician assessments\n(25% to 83%).5 Additionally, BCCT.core's applicability is limited for patients\nunderwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS). This limitation arises because the\nsoftware's objective indices are primarily designed for patients who have\nundergone breast-conserving surgery.\n\nGAN model is a recently emerging novel technique widely adopted in field of\nimaging due to its exceptionally plausible ability to detect abnormalities\nbetween normal images by deep learning. Building upon our prior work\nestablishing the feasibility of a GAN-based Anomaly score (AS) for predicting\ncosmetic outcomes in breast cancer patients, we explored the long-term impact\nof radiotherapy (RT) on patients with permanent implants5. While our previous\nstudy demonstrated excellent predictive capability and highlighted the\ndetrimental effects of RT on patients with tissue expanders compared to\nautologous reconstruction, it was limited to a single institution and focused\non patients with tissue expanders at the time of analysis.\n\nTherefore, to comprehensively evaluate the influence of RT on permanent\nimplants, we validated the applicability of the previously developed GAN\nmodel. Additionally, we built a Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP)\nmodel incorporating relevant clinical factors to predict the likelihood of\nmajor complications after RT.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nWe computed the AS using a previously established fast anomaly generative\nadversarial network (f-AnoGAN) model. The f-AnoGAN model consists of two\nprimary components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator is trained\nto produce realistic medical images from random noise, while the discriminator\nis trained to distinguish between real and generated images. After training,\nthe model identifies anomalies by comparing real images to generated ones,\nhighlighting discrepancies. This approach leverages the unsupervised learning\ncapabilities of GANs to efficiently identify and localize anomalies without\nthe need for labeled data. As described in our previous research, the f-AnoGAN\nmodel was trained using normal breast images from 251 patients who underwent\nBCS5. The validation dataset consisted of 82 breast cancer patients who\nunderwent immediate reconstruction surgery followed by radiotherapy between\nJanuary 2016 and December 2020.

We found that EGR1 was significantly downregulated in\ntumor tissues compared with normal tissues (Figure 1A). Then, we validated\nthis result using our own samples, demonstrating that the mRNA levels of EGR1\nwere decreased in 37 out of 50 BC patients (Figure 1B and C).

CRS\nis a systemic inflammatory response caused by the release of large amounts of\ncytokines by activated T cells. Upon CAR-T cell engagement with target cancer\ncells, an intense activation occurs, leading to the rapid proliferation of\nthese engineered cells and the subsequent release of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines. This cytokine storm, featuring elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-\u03b3,\nTNF-\u03b1, and others, triggers a cascade of immune responses that recruit\nadditional immune cells into the fray. The excessive cytokine levels then\nprecipitate a systemic inflammatory response, manifesting in symptoms ranging\nfrom mild fever to severe multi-organ dysfunction. CRS occurs in a significant\nproportion of patients treated with CAR-T cell therapies, with severe CRS\noccurring in up to 30% of cases, depending on the specific CAR-T construct and\nthe disease being treated [26\u201329]. Treatment for alleviating CRS includes the\nadministration of tocilizumab (an IL-6 receptor antagonist) and\ncorticosteroids, which can be effective but may also dampen the antitumor\neffects of the CAR-T cells [30]. From the early clinical data, they suggest\nthat CRS is less common and less severe with CAR-NK cell therapies [31].\nUnlike T cells, the inherent immunological properties of NK cells provide a\nhigher activation threshold and do not require antigen-specific activation,\nleading to a more controlled cytokine release upon encountering target cells.\nNK cells inherently lack the robust proliferative response seen in T cells,\ncurtailing the magnitude of cytokine secretion. Furthermore, their cytotoxic\naction is predominantly direct and does not depend extensively on cytokine-\nmediated pathways but involve a complex interplay of activating and inhibitory\nreceptors due to the balance of NCRs (NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, etc.) and KIRs. The\nmilder nature of CRS with CAR-NK cells may reduce the need for intensive\nmanagement strategies, potentially allowing for outpatient treatment.\n\nNeurotoxicity, another serious complication during CAR-T treatment, presents\nwith symptoms ranging from confusion to severe seizures and cerebral edema,\nwhich has been observed in up to 50% of patients receiving certain CAR-T cell\ntherapies [26, 27]. Elevated cytokines following CAT-T infusion compromise the\nblood-brain barrier (BBB), enabling immune cells, including activated CAR-T\ncells, to infiltrate the central neuro system (CNS).

Results from the study indicated\nimproved progression-free survival in the neratinib arm, with a hazard ratio\nof 0.76 (95% CI, 0.63\u20130.93; p = 0.0059) [81].\n\nNeratinib has shown effectiveness in inhibiting growth in cell lines resistant\nto trastuzumab, and it exhibits synergy when used in combination with\ntrastuzumab [82,83].\n\nIn the TBCRC022, Co3 phase II clinical trial, the efficacy of neratinib plus\ncapecitabine was investigated in patients with CNS progression following prior\nCNS-directed treatment. In the group not receiving lapatinib (Cohort A), the\nCNS overall response rate (CNS-ORR) was 49% (95% CI: 32\u201366%), while in the\ngroup in which lapatinib was administrated (Cohort B), it was 33% (95% CI:\n10\u201365%). The median progression-free survival (PFS) durations for cohorts A\nand B were 5.5 and 3.1 months [84].\n\n3.4. Tucatinib: A New Hope in Cancer Treatment\n\nEven if PFS (Progression-Free Survival) and OS (Overall Survival) in using\nHER2 molecular-targeted therapies to treat breast cancer increased, addressing\ntherapeutic resistance, especially in the context of metastatic diseases,\ncontinues to be a significant challenge in clinical practice [66,85,86]. In\norder to overcome resistance, the combination of monoclonal antibodies\ntargeting HER2 with small-molecule inhibitors of HER2 was thought to be a\nsolution. However, in some cases, this caused toxicities because of the off-\ntarget inhibition of other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as EGFR and\nHER4 [87,88].\n\nAdditionally, the current antibody-based treatments approved for use have\nlimited ability to penetrate the central nervous system (CNS), and they show\nreduced efficacy against CNS metastases in some cases [67,79,84].\n\nIt is in this context that tucatinib was developed. Tucatinib is an orally\nadministered and selective small-molecule inhibitor of HER2. It acts by\ntargeting the HER2 receptor with a high degree of specificity, exhibiting more\nthan a 50-fold selectivity for HER2 over EGFR. Notably, tucatinib has the\nability to penetrate the blood\u2013brain barrier effectively [89,90,91].\n\nIn 2022, O\u2019Brien et al. analyzed 456 molecularly characterized cell lines from\nvarious cancer types to assess the potential efficacy of tucatinib-based\ntherapies.

Clinically, due to the inter-technique variability of LVEF\nmeasurements, it is important that the same modality and technique be used for\nserial LVEF assessment where possible [7,12].\n\nThe severity and the reversibility of CTRCD are variable and are often\ndependent on both patient and cancer therapy-related factors [15]. CTRCD\nclassification by reversibility patterns has previously been proposed, with\ntype I (dose-related myocyte injury and thought to be irreversible) and type\nII injuries (shown to have reversibility with drug cessation); however, with\ncomplex regimens and sometimes a brief administration of agents, this\nclassification may be difficult to apply in clinical practice and is less used\nnowadays [12,18].

Importantly, CTRCD risk is dynamic and risk assessment should\noccur both at baseline, to guide the frequency of surveillance intensity of\nprevention efforts, and again throughout and after cancer treatments [6].\n\n4.1.

What Is Autophagy Dependence?\n\nAutophagy is an evolutionarily conserved ubiquitous process that recycles\nunnecessary or dysfunctional cellular components through a lysosome-dependent\nmechanism that provides the energy and materials necessary for growth,\nsurvival, and development. Since cancer cells can proliferate continuously\nunder conditions where normal cells undergo quiescence [1], they develop a\ndependence on autophagy to the point of \u2018addiction\u2019 in order to survive under\nnutrient-limited conditions [2].\n\nAutophagy dependence in cells are functionally detected in three ways: (1)\ndependence on autophagy core ATG genes, e.g., ATG5 and ATG7 [3], (2) high\nsensitivity to lysosomal activity inhibitors, e.g., chloroquine and\nhydroxychloroquine [4], and (3) sensitivity to PIKFYVE inhibitors that disrupt\nthe endo-lysosomal pathway and disrupt lysosomal homeostasis [5,6,7,8,9].\n\nMelanoma A375 cells, which are homozygous for the BRAFV600E mutation, were\noriginally termed \u2018autophagy-addicted\u2019, because ablation of genes essential\nfor autophagy in models of BRAFV600E-driven cancer impaired mitochondrial\nmetabolism and increased the survival of BRAFV600E tumor-bearing mice [10,11].\nConsequently, melanoma A375 cells require autophagy for cell growth,\nproliferation, and viability even when cultured in rich medium, as evidenced\nby their sensitivity to lysosome inhibitors hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine\n[12]. Autophagy dependence is also revealed by sensitivity to established\nautophagy inhibitors and by high levels of the autophagosome-associated\nprotein LC3B-II [5,13,14,15]. In advanced stages of tumorigenesis, many types\nof solid tumors, primary as well as metastatic, have been shown to depend on\nautophagy to cope with nutritional stress conditions that develop in the tumor\nmicroenvironment [16,17,18].\n\nDifferent clinical trials to suppress autophagy-dependent cancers relied\nmostly on inhibitors of lysosomal degradation, e.g., chloroquine and\nhydroxychloroquine [19,20,21]. However, an acidic tumor microenvironment might\ninactivate these inhibitors, allowing cancer cells to escape the inhibitory\neffect of these molecules [22,23]. Small-molecule inhibitors of the PIKFYVE\nhave been shown to disrupt lysosome homeostasis, which involves all three\ntypes of autophagy in mammals [macro-autophagy, micro-autophagy, and\nchaperone-mediated autophagy [24], henceforth simply termed autophagy], as\nwell as\n\n", "question": "What is autophagy?", "answer": "Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved ubiquitous process that recycles unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular components through a lysosome-dependent mechanism that provides the energy and materials necessary for growth, survival, and development."}

Moreover,\ndifferentiated tumor cells were significantly more common not only in BL1 TNBC\nbut also in ER+ and luminal A, while enriched mesenchymal-like BCSC were\npredominantly found in the ER-, BL2, and M TNBC subtypes. Notably, more highly\npurified ALDH+CD24\u2212CD44+ BCSCs were found in ER breast cancers [53].\n\nMore interesting data indicate the role of high immunoexpression of ALDH1 in\nearly invasive BC. This profile is connected with poor prognostic hallmarks,\nlike a high grade, poor Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI), and lymph node\nmetastasis. These features are observed in highly proliferative ER+ luminal BC\nand TNBC subtypes. Moreover, ALDH1 expression was positively correlated with\nthe expression of CD44, TWIST, SOX9, EPCAM, and CD133 at the protein level.\nThis was associated with poor prognostic characteristics and poor outcomes,\nparticularly in the luminal B and TNBC subtypes [54].\n\nSelected miRNA expression level is also a known characteristic of BCSCs.

It reduces transcription factor\n8 expression and increases E-cadherin expression, which is associated with\ntumor dedifferentiation and increased metastatic potential in human carcinomas\n[55,56]. Additionally, the miR-200 family, miR-9, and miR-155 have been\nreported to correlate with EMT and BCSC phenotypes. miR-9 is highly expressed\nin HER2-positive and TNBC subtypes.

Furthermore, Tregs inhibit the expression of co-stimulatory\nmolecules, antigen-presenting molecules, and inflammatory cytokines in APCs,\nthus attenuating their ability to stimulate T-cell responses\n[132,133,136,137]. Tregs upregulate the indolemine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)\npathway, which leads to the degradation of tryptophan. The IDO pathway is\nactivated through the reverse signaling of CTLA4 on dendritic cells, resulting\nin the expression of IDO and subsequent tryptophan metabolism into the\nkynurenine pathway, which inhibits T cell activity and induces T cell\napoptosis [138,139]. Moreover, Tregs disrupt Il-2 receptor signaling,\nhindering DC activation and subsequently suppressing Teff proliferation. IL-2\nalso influences the expression of perforin and granzyme genes in CD8+ T cells\n[140]. Thus, Tregs exert influence across all phases of the immune response.\n\nIn summary, the mechanisms underlying Treg-mediated suppression of target\ncells can be delineated as follows (Figure 2): (1) Selective expression of\ncell surface inhibitory receptors, such as CTLA-4, TIGIT, LAG-3, PD-1, and\nTIM-3; (2) Direct cell-to-cell contact, utilizing mechanisms such as granzyme\nB and perforin or Fas/Fasl for target cell dissolution; (3) Secretion of\nimmunosuppressive cytokines, including TGF-\u03b2, IL-10, IL-35, etc.; (4)\nInduction of IL-2 depletion within the microenvironment, resulting in \u201cIL-2\nsink\u201d; (5) Modulation of the TME through metabolic alterations, such as\nfacilitating adenosine accumulation and competing for nutrients, thereby\norchestrating T cell polarization and various biological processes; (6)\nUtilizing extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a novel suppressive mechanism,\nallowing for cell-contact independent and targeted immune modulation\n[141,142].\n\n6\\. The Potential Anti-Tumor Role of Tregs\n\nAs our understanding of Tregs deepens, the initial view that Tregs always lead\nto poor tumor prognosis has been found to be biased. Particularly in the later\nstages of cancer, Tregs have been discovered to possess various potential\nanti-tumor mechanisms. In studies of colorectal cancer, HNSCC, and gastric\ncancer, Treg infiltration has been positively correlated with extended\nsurvival times in cancer patients, suggesting that Tregs can play a proactive\nrole in suppressing tumor development [11,13,14,143,144]. This effect is\nrelated to the stability of Tregs, their subgroup transformation, and their\nability to downregulate inflammation that promotes tumor progression.\n\n6.1.

A clinical trial\nof its combination with mFOLFOX6 for frontline HER-positive metastatic CRC is\ncurrently recruiting (MOUNTAINEER-03, NCT05253651).\n\n2.1.3. KRAS\n\nThe activation of EGFR and other RTKs triggers several signaling pathways,\nwith RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK being one of the most important. The phosphorylation of\nRAS starts a chain reaction that activates RAF, MEK, and ERK, which in turn\ntranslocate into the nucleus, regulating multiple transcription factors and\ngene expressions, controlling growth, proliferation, differentiation, and\nmigration. This pathway also has the ability to activate PI3K and the\ndownstream signaling pathway [8].\n\nKRAS, NRAS, and HRAS belong to the RAS oncogene family, one of the most\nfrequently mutated gene families across all cancers, with nearly half of all\nCRC patients presenting with RAS mutations [21]. With this pathway independent\nof upstream activation, these mutations are associated with a poor prognosis\nand resistance to anti-EGFR therapies. Over the last two decades, different\nstrategies have been used to target these oncogenes without success, until the\nrecent development of KRAS G12C inhibitors.\n\nThe KRAS G12C mutation is found in approximately 4% of patients with CRC and\nconfers a particular tridimensional shape to the protein, with a binding\npocket called the switch-II pocket [22]. This characteristic has allowed the\ndevelopment of various compounds that covalently bind to the pocket,\nmaintaining the protein in its inactive form. Sotorasib (AMG 510) showed\nactivity in solid tumors harboring the KRAS G12C mutation, including CRC.

Genome Instability and Mutation\n\nAs described by Hanahan and Weinberg, cancer cells gain certain abilities\nthrough their ability to mutate [6]. By increasing sensitivity to mutagenic\nagents and defective maintenance machinery, mutation rates are much higher\nthan in normal cells, providing a variety of clones that can prevail in the\ntumor environment.\n\nIt is of utmost importance to maintain the integrity of a cell\u2019s DNA and for\nthe cell to monitor for any errors that may put at risk the correct\ntransmission of information and potentially the viability of the cell.\nDifferent DNA repair mechanisms exist in all cells to address this [69].\nFirstly, direct reversal of the chemical reaction that caused the DNA damage,\nwhich is important in repairing UV light damage. Secondly, the removal of\ndamaged bases, known as excision repair, which can be accomplished by removing\nthe damaged base (base-excision repair, BER), the removal of an\noligonucleotide containing the damage (nucleotide-excision repair, NER), or\nthe scanning of the DNA during replication by the DNA polymerase (MMR). And\nlastly, after completion of replication, if previous mechanisms have failed,\ndouble-strand DNA can be repaired by homology-directed repair (HR) and\nnonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Most cancer cells have defects in one of\nthese repair systems, including dMMR in CRC.\n\nPoly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) not only has an important role in BER, but\nalso helps recruit other repair proteins that play a part in HR and regulates\nthe expression of BRCA1 and RAD51. The inhibition of PARP in a cell with an\nexisting defect in the DNA damage repair system leads to synthetic lethality,\na situation in which the disruption of two genes simultaneously is not viable,\nresulting in cell death [69]. This is the rationale for the use of PARP\ninhibitors in tumors with mutated BRCA1/2. Moreover, this synthetic lethality\nis associated with the release of neoantigens, resulting in an increased\nimmune response that leads to the idea of combining PARP inhibitors and ICIs.\nOther effects of PARP inhibitors have been linked to enhanced immunity and\nhave laid the groundwork for studies of combination strategies. PARP\ninhibitors can upregulate the expression of PD-L1 [70,71] and also play a role\nin activating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, as well as blocking macrophage\ndifferentiation towards an M2 subtype, creating a more inflammatory TME [<xref\nref-type=\"bibr\"\n\n", "question": "What is the rationale for the use of PARP inhibitors in tumors with mutated BRCA1/2?", "answer": "The inhibition of PARP in a cell with an existing defect in the DNA damage repair system leads to synthetic lethality, a situation in which the disruption of two genes simultaneously is not viable, resulting in cell death."}

The flow cytometric analysis\nrevealed an average NK cell purity of around 80% for cells isolated out of\nuntreated buffy coats (R) (Figure 2C and Figure S8).

Introduction\n\nLipid-based nanoparticles, such as liposomes, have gained prominence in drug\nand gene delivery due to their compact size, enhanced cellular uptake,\nprolonged action, and reduced systemic side effects. They have many other\nadvantages, including their formulation simplicity, self-assembly-based\nproduction, ability to carry large payloads of nucleic acids, potential for\ncell-targeted drug delivery, and controllable physicochemical properties that\ncan be used to modulate their biological characteristics. For these reasons,\nlipid-based nanoparticles are the most common class of FDA-approved\nnanomedicines [1,2]. However, despite these advantages, lipid-based\nnanoparticles face several limitations. These include potential instability\nduring storage, susceptibility to environmental factors, challenges related to\ndrug loading, and achieving high encapsulation efficiency for therapeutic\nagents [3,4]. To address these issues, further research is necessary to\noptimize liposome drug loading techniques. Additionally, a comprehensive\nunderstanding of their structural properties is crucial for refining their\ndesign and achieving improved therapeutic outcomes.\n\nClassical lipid-based lipoplexes are based on electrostatic binding between\ncationic lipids and nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA [5]. Even though\nlipoplexes can be conveniently produced, their preparation is often poorly\ncontrolled, leading to polydisperse particles with unpredictable and variable\nefficacy of transfection or silencing in target cells. More specifically,\nthese classical production methods have drawbacks for nucleic acid delivery\n[1,2,3,4,6]. Non-uniform lipoplexes are formed due to the poorly controlled\nfusion of liposomes or other lipid vesicles with nucleic acids in solution\n[2]. This may lead to heterogenous interactions (electrostatic, hydrophobic,\nsurface adsorption) and opsonization within the lipoplexes, resulting in non-\nreproducible interactions with target cells and extracellular components. The\nlarge and heterogeneous size of lipoplexes limits in vivo transfection due to\npoor escape from the vascular bed and sub-optimal endocytic entry to the\ntarget cells [1]. Unencapsulated nucleic acids are unstable in the body and\nvulnerable to degradation by nucleases [3]. The reticuloendothelial system\nrapidly clears large and heterogeneous lipoplexes that are also more\nsusceptible to surface opsonization that tends to hamper targeted delivery to\nthe sites of therapeutic action [4].\n\nThe method that is gaining lots of interest and currently in common use is\nmicrofluidics. Microfluidics is a form of fluid handling that implements the\nmixing of organic solvents with an aqueous phase in a chip-based device [7].\nThe size of liposomes can be determined by different parameters like flow rate\nratio, total flow rate, and concentration of organic solvent or lipid\nconcentration [8].

The\ninformation provided in this narrative literature review could be used for\nfuture studies.\n\n2\\. Structural Aspects of ADCs\n\nAs presented in Figure 2, the main components of an ADC are three basic\nelements: monoclonal antibody, linker, and payload [11,24,25,26,27].\n\n2.1. Monoclonal Antibodies\n\nAll antibodies have a shared basic structure (Figure 2) with two heavy\npolypeptide chains (green) and two light chains (blue), both of which are\ncomposed of different regions that are either constant (C) or variable (V) in\nsequence. They are assembled into a Y-shaped structure by means of a number of\ninter- and intrachain disulfide bonds and also different non-covalent\ninteractions. Short carbohydrate chains that are bound to heavy polypeptide\nchains enhance the water solubility of the mAb, and a flexible \u201chinge\u201d region\nlocated in the middle of the antibody enables it to adapt to various\narrangements of antigens on target cell surfaces [11,25,26,27,28].\n\nThe mAb is the main component of the ADC structure [24]. It is necessary for\nthe specific attachment between the target antigens and the ADC, specific for\nan antigen predominantly expressed on a tumor cell with the role of\ntransporting the payload (cytotoxic drug) to the targeted site of action [10].\nTo maximize ADC efficacy, selection of an antibody must prioritize a well-\ncharacterized antigen with minimal or absent expression in normal tissues\nwhile minimizing off-target toxicity [23]. In the initial phases of ADC drug\ndevelopment, antibodies obtained from laboratory animals (mice) were used.\nHowever, this approach resulted in high failure rates due to severe side\neffects caused by immunogenicity [10]. In the last decades, with the\ndevelopment of recombinant DNA technology, murine antibodies have mostly been\nsubstituted with chimeric, humanized or human (fully humanized) antibodies,\nthe latter showing a significant reduction in immunogenicity [29]. Another\nimportant aspect is the internalization efficiency of the ADC\u2013antigen complex,\nwhich depends on the binding affinity of the antibody to the antigen. Adequate\naffinity is essential for the rapid internalization of the ADC\u2013antigen\ncomplex. Very frequently used mAbs in ADCs are the human IgG isotypes, which\nhave the advantage of a long half life, the capacity to bring about heightened\nantibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent\ncytotoxicity against cancer cells [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"\n\n", "question": "What are the three main components of an antibody drug conjugate (ADC)?", "answer": "The three main components of an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) are a monoclonal antibody, a linker, and a payload."}

Besides,\nsatisfactory predictive performance of this nomogram was validated in three\nindependent datasets, including the TCGA, GSE76250, and GSE58812.

Hence, our diagnostic nomogram has the potential to aid identifying\nideal TNBC patients who may benefit from ICIs, thereby providing\nimmunotherapeutic guidance.\n\nThere were some limitations in this study.

Metformin, reducing insulin/IGF-1 blood\nlevels, inhibits the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway and improves the cellular\nmetabolism in normal and cancer cells. One major effect of metformin may be\nthe suppression of the mTOR signaling pathway. Reductions in the circulating\nlevels of insulin and IGF-1 in the peripheral blood and the activation of the\nliver kinase B1 (LKB1)/AMPK signaling pathway cause the inhibition of the mTOR\npathway, resulting in cell proliferation, protein translation, and insulin\nlevels [336]. The inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway reduces the\nexpression of the proto-oncogenes Cyclin D1 and c-MYC, causing the inhibition\nof the proliferation, migration, and epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition of\nthyroid cancer cells [337,338,339]. Other mechanisms of the anti-cancer\nactivity of metformin suggest an inhibition of complex I of the mitochondrial\nelectron transport chain, causing the attenuation of oxidative respiration,\nresulting in ATP/AMP balance. This disturbance, in turn, activates the LKB1\nand AMPK signaling pathway, comprising the inhibition of mTOR, Cyclin D1, and\np53 interference, causing antiproliferative effects of the discussed drug\n[36]. Other mechanisms are also suggested [111,321].\n\n5.2. Thiazolidinediones\n\nThiazolidinediones (TZDs), also called glitozones, are insulin-sensitizing\nperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-\u03b3 agonists. TZDs improve\nglucose and lipid metabolism due to an increase in the sensitivity of target\ncells to insulin [340], reducing insulin resistance [341]. PPAR-\u03b3 is a nuclear\nreceptor which with retinoid X receptor (RXR) forms a heterodimer and\nregulates the expression of genes associated with insulin action, the\ndifferentiation of adipocytes, inflammation, and metabolism [342]. The\nactivation of PPAR-\u03b3 by TZDs initiates the differentiation of adipocytes,\ndecreases the release of free fatty acids from adipocytes, and the synthesis\nand release of prostaglandins, TNF-\u03b1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), leptin, and\nresistin by adipocytes. An effect of PPAR-\u03b3 is also an increased production of\nadiponectin, glucose disposal by adipocytes, and insulin sensitivity [342].\nHowever, the main role of TZDs is their metabolic action in T2DM [341], and it\nis suggested that these drugs may be involved as anti-tumor agents, affecting\nthe cell cycle, apoptosis, and cell proliferation [343]. On the other hand,\nmany clinical studies have showed that treatment with TZDs did not have a\nsignificant anti-cancer effect in some cancers [344,345,346]. In 2005, the\npositive anti-cancer effect of pioglitazone used in patients with T2DM [347]\nwas first suggested.

Cell membranes contain small invaginations called caveolae. The\nformation of caveolae relies on two protein classes: caveolins and cavins,\nwhich form extensive complexes enabling self-assembly into caveolae\nstructures. In cancers, the expression of caveolins and cavins varies,\nundergoing alterations both within tumors and in the surrounding stromal cells\nof the tumor microenvironment. Significantly, their expression and function\nhave been linked to resistance against numerous cancer drugs [34].\n\nPre-rRNA-processing protein (TSR2) was upregulated more than twice in all\ngroups, with only luminal B showing 1,6 times. According to the last\nobservations, TSR2 releases small ribosomal subunit protein eS26 (RPS26) from\nmature ribosomes to remodel ribosome populations. Moreover, TSR2 stores free\nRPS26 and promotes re-incorporation of the protein, thereby repairing the\nsubunit after the stress subsides. Moreover, insufficiency of ribosomal\nproteins can lead to the accumulation of ribosomes lacking these proteins and,\nin human cells, predispose them to cancer [35].\n\nBattenin (CLN3) is a transmembrane protein implicated in numerous biological\nfunctions, such as osmoregulation, autophagy, apoptosis, lysosomal pH\nregulation, ceramide metabolism, cell cycle modulation, cell migration, and\nproliferation.

In MCF-7 KO HTM,\nboth treatments show equivalent treatment efficiencies as well; however, a\nmarginal tumor growth remained in the tamoxifen-treated mice. The very slight\ndifference observed in treated WT and KO HTM can be attributed to the\ninitially faster tumor growth of HER4 KO tumors. Thus, an enhanced therapy\nefficiency upon HER4 knockdown could not be observed in this study, because\nthe WT cells appeared highly sensitive ab initio; therefore, this HTM-based\nstudy reflects a prognostic impact rather than a predictive effect of HER4, at\nleast when highly sensitive tumor cells are used. However, it must be\nconsidered that the treatment period monitored in this study is significantly\nshorter than the therapy range used for patients. Tumor progression and the\ndevelopment of therapy resistance typically takes much longer, particularly in\nluminal BC [64,65]. Considering HER4-dependent tumor growth in HTM, the\nobservation time of tumor growth in HTM is relatively short (~five weeks) and\nonly partially reflects a long-time disease (i.e., progression).

However, the abemaciclib treatment\ninduced immunological changes, which point towards a, immunosuppressive\nreaction, especially in HER4 KO mice. Abemaciclib-treated HTM showed a reduced\nspleen weight (less proliferative activity) and reduced PD-1 expression on\nCD8+ T and NK cells (reduced activation). Notably, other researchers who used\nmouse BC models also reported a reduced expression of checkpoint molecules on\nimmune cells upon CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy [66,67]; however, they associated\nthis finding with less T cell exhaustion. Schaer et al. also described a\nreduced spleen cell count upon abemaciclib treatment in BALB/c mice, but\nsupposed an association with reduced tumor burden [68]. In addition to a\nreduced PD-1 expression on splenic CD8+ T cells, the abemaciclib-treated WT\nHTM analyzed in this study showed a downregulation of MHC I on tumor cells.\nThis MHC I downregulation has been described as an immune evasion mechanism\nassociated with a decreased intratumoral immune cell infiltration and activity\n[69].

Mechanistically, the MCDD\ndiet augmented hepatic IL17RA expression and increased the hepatic\ninfiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes. Increased Th17 infiltration led\nto the further secretion of IL17 to upregulate the hepatic expression of\nmacrophage and lymphocyte chemokine CXCL10 expression, thus forming a positive\nloop to enhance immune cell infiltration [71,72]. In a high-fat diet\n(HFD)-induced NAFLD mouse model, IL-17A and IL17-RA expression increased after\nHFD challenge; in comparison, the knockout of IL17-RA increased steatosis but\ndecreased steatohepatitis, suggesting a central role of the IL-17 axis in the\ndevelopment and progression of NAFLD to steatohepatitis [73].

Introduction\n\nHistone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), which target with different\nspecificities, class I (1, 2, 3 and 8), IIa (4 and 7), IIb (6 and 10), III\n(Sirtuins), and IV (11) histone deacetylases (HDACs) are emerging as promising\nanticancer drugs [1]. Among these, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA),\nalso named vorinostat, inhibits classes I and II of HDACs. It was the first to\nbe approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma\n(CTCL) [2]. With the exception of class III, the deacetylating activity of all\nHDACi, including SAHA, is zinc-dependent, and in fact all these molecules\ncontain a zinc-binding group (ZBG) [3]. In addition to histone acetylation,\nwhich determines chromatin relaxation and facilitates gene transcription,\nHDACi treatment can increase the acetylation of non-histone proteins. SAHA has\nalso been reported to enhance the acetylating activity of drugs such as\nresveratrol, leading to acetylation of p53 and activating its pro-apoptotic\nfunction in prostate cancer cells [4]. Depending on treatments, p53 can be\nacetylated at multiple lysine sites, e.g., lys 381 and 382 by HDAC6 inhibitors\n[5], lys373 and lys382 by acetyltransferases such as p300 and CBP and lys320\nby PCAF (p300/CBP associated factor) [6]. Together with phosphorylation at\nspecific residues, acetylation leads to the activation of wtp53, even\nfollowing treatments by DNA-damaging agents [7]. Moreover, HDAC6 inhibition\nhas been reported to reduce the stability of mutant p53 (mutp53), by\ninterfering with HSP90, leading to its proteasomal degradation [8]. Tumors,\nand pancreatic cancer, in particular, are characterized by numerous genetic\nabnormalities, including the p53 mutations, detected in more than 75% of\npancreatic cancer cases [9]. Since p53 lysine acetylation does not occur in\nthe DNA binding domain (DBD) where point mutations usually occur, this post-\ntranslational modification (PTM) does not distinguish between wt- and mutp53\nand may therefore affect both proteins. It was recently shown that although\nboth wt- and mutp53 can undergo acetylation, this PTM regulates their function\nin opposite ways, resulting in stabilization of wtp53 and destabilization of\n(R175H) mutp53, as demonstrated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [10].\nThis is particularly important, since p53, the most important gatekeeper of\nthe genome, often undergoes missense mutations in tumor cells, resulting in\nthe loss of DNA-binding ability and often in the acquisition of oncogenic\nproperties (GOF) [11,12]. However, it remains to be investigated whether other\nmutant p53 proteins may be affected by acetylation in a similar manner and\nwhether this may occur in tumor cells other than NSCLC. Besides acetylation,\nHDACi can influence DNA methylation, as they can for example inhibit DNA\nmethyltransferase-3B, [13], resulting in a further activation of gene\ntranscription. On the other hand, histone deacetylation can be influenced by\nDNA methylation, since DNA methyltransferase1 (Dnmt1), an enzyme that mediates\nDNA methylation, can also have histone deacetylation properties [14].\nTherefore, DNA demethylating agents such as 5-AZA could indirectly interfere\nwith HDAC\n\n", "question": "What is the effect of HDAC6 inhibition on mutant p53?", "answer": "HDAC6 inhibition has been reported to reduce the stability of mutant p53 (mutp53), by interfering with HSP90, leading to its proteasomal degradation."}

ADLs represent the fundamental self-care tasks\nneeded to preserve independence at home (such taking a shower) while iADLs\ninclude the more sophisticated tasks required to preserve independence in the\ncommunity (like going shopping). Higher treatment tolerance and lower survival\nrates have been linked to older cancer patients\u2019 demand for help with\ninstrumental activities of daily living (iADLs).

In\nso doing, reinnervation of the breast threatened to result in denervation of\nthe abdominal wall, increasing the potential for complications like abdominal\nbulge or hernia [49,57]. To address this problem, in 2018, the senior author\n(A.M.) introduced a novel method for harvesting only a sensory branch to the\nabdominal flap tissue, thereby preserving motor innervation of the abdominal\nwall [47].\n\nIn this technique, sensory nerves are identified traveling with lateral row\nperforating vessels toward the skin during standard abdominal flap elevation.\nIf the flap is to be based on lateral row vessels, the anterior rectus sheath\nis incised in line with these perforators, as is commonly performed in DIEP\nflap harvest. Retrograde dissection of a centrally located sensory nerve is\nperformed until a sensory\u2013motor Y-junction is encountered, typically\nrepresenting a bifurcation of ICN 11 or 12. The sensory branch is clipped and\ndivided distal to the Y-junction, thus, preserving the motor branch to the\nrectus abdominis muscle. If the flap is based on medial perforators, a lateral\nsensory nerve branch is isolated and harvested via a separate 5 mm incision in\nthe fascia (Figure 1), which is closed with a single figure-of-eight stitch\n[47,53,56]. The rest of flap elevation and pedicle dissection proceed in\nstandard fashion.\n\nThe sensory-only nerve branch harvested using this technique is typically no\nlonger than 3 cm and, therefore, too short to reach recipient targets; to\naddress this issue, our group has described a second innovation: the use of\nbridging nerve allograft to facilitate tension-free coaptation to the anterior\ncutaneous branch of ICN 3 in the chest (Figure 2) [47,53,56]. Following\nmastectomy, the pectoralis major is split over the third rib, and the third\ncostal cartilage is removed in typical fashion. The posterior perichondrium is\nincised and reflected medially, facilitating exposure of ICN 3 running along\nthe inferior border of the rib as it courses superficially over the internal\nmammary vessels. Of note, ICN 3 can also be used if a rib-sparing approach is\nutilized. The nerve is divided at the level of the internal mammary artery and\nreflected laterally for coaptation.

Next, the\nabdominal flap is transferred to the chest and microvascular anastomoses to\nthe internal mammary vessels are performed in standard fashion. Following flap\nrevascularization, distal nerve coaptation to the sensory branch of ICN 11 or\n12 supplying the flap is performed (Figure 3).

Nevertheless, this relationship between miRNAs\nand microbiota appears to be bidirectional, as miRNAs can also influence the\nsurvival and composition of bacteria [9]. For example, miRNAs can influence\nbacterial abundance in the tumor environment by regulating glucose metabolism,\nthereby modulating tumor growth [16].\n\nIn our study, we aimed to uncover the potential link between tumoral miRNA\nexpression, intratumoral microbiota, and the presence of metastasis in BC\npatients. To achieve this, we investigated the differential tumoral expression\nof specific miRNAs, including miR-149-5p, miR-10a-5p, miR-20b-5p, miR-30a-3p,\nand miR-342-5p, along with the composition of intratumoral microbiota through\n16S RNAr sequencing in BC patients with and without metastasis. The five\nmiRNAs chosen for this study were identified from a previous study that\nvalidated a multi-miRNA-based model from a total of 1105 different miRNAs. In\nthis previous study, we observed significant expression differences in these\nselected miRNAs between BC patients with early metastasis and those who\nremained disease-free 5 years post-surgery [19]. While the association between\nmiRNAs and microbiota has been explored in other cancer types, this study\nrepresents a novel exploration of this interplay in BC.\n\n2\\. Results2.1.

Intrinsic subtypes were grouped in the\nNonMet-BC and Met-BC groups, respectively, as follows: 7 (16.7%) and 16\n(21.6%) were identified as Luminal A, 20 (47.6%) and 26 (35.1%) as Luminal\nB-HER2 negative, 6 (14.3%) and 4 (5.4%) as Luminal B-HER2 positive, 5 (14.3%)\nand 15 (20.3%) as triple-negative tumors, and 3 (7.1%) and 13 (17.6%) as HER2\nenriched. Related to the location of the first metastasis process, the most\nfrequent sites were bone (28.4%), liver (24.3%), and lung (13.5%).\n\n2.2.

PDOs\ncorrectly classified 80% and 83.3% of the patients, respectively, that\nresponded to irinotecan alone or associated to 5FU. On the contrary, PDO could\nnot predict the response to 5FU plus oxaliplatin. The authors suggested that\nthis discrepancy could be linked to the contribution of tumor stroma/immune\ncells (lacking in PDOs) to the overall effect in patients. Wang et al. [185]\nobtained an overall 77% establishment of primary mCRC cultures. The authors\nprepared a first cohort of PDO to identify the IC50 of standard chemotherapy\ncombinations (XELOX/FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) that was applied to a second cohort\nwith predictive purposes. Finally, 45 patients were eligible for comparison\nwith their matched PDOs, showing 63% sensitivity, 94% specificity, and 79%\naccuracy in predicting responses.\n\nThese studies have indicated PDOs as reliable models for predicting patients\u2019\nresponse to standard therapy. Accordingly, they also represent a unique tool\nto test new drug combinations for personalized medicine. Ramzy et al. [186]\npublished an interesting approach integrating PDOs and statistical modeling.\nThis study identified a four-drug, low-dose combination (Regorafenib,\nVemurafenib, Lapatinib, and Palbociclib), that outperformed standard FOLFOXIRI\ntreatment in 3D CRC cultures. While this short-term test (72 h treatment)\ncannot foresee the overall effect in the long term, it represents a good\napproach for a fast-predictive assay after surgery. Noticeably, the four-drug\ncombination described by these authors, as with broad-spectrum activity,\ncontained two drugs (Regorafenib and Vemurafenib) that were expected to target\nonly specific cells (endothelial cells and BRAF-V600E mutated cells). This\nimplies that some off-target biochemical effects of synthetic inhibitors could\nturn out therapeutic. Indeed, we recently showed that the P38 inhibitor,\nSB202190, can mimic the BRAF V600E inhibitor, Dabrafenib, outperforming it in\nlong-term inhibition tests on BRAF-mutated PDOs [187].\n\nPDOs are not only useful for direct drug testing, but also to study\ntumor\u2013immune cell interactions. We have recently shown that a Cetuximab\n(Cet)\u2013Zoledronate (ZA) antibody\u2013drug conjugate (Cet\u2013ZA ADC) can trigger V\u03b42 T\nlymphocytes activation, causing expansion and cytotoxicity against CRC PDOs\n[188] (Figure 7). Notably, the same ADC also triggered the response of V\u03b42 T\ncells against CRC fibroblasts, indicating a promising tool which is able to\ndually target cancer and its stroma.\n\nAlso, the identification of rare genetic profiles by exome and transcriptome\nanalyses can be identified using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system such\nas mucosa organoids of early-onset CRC. This approach together with the\nanalysis of patient-derived biopsies can also identify tumor suppressor genes\nand pre-malignant mutations [189,190,191,192].

The translational errors\nfor the SGRT group in the above study were similar to those of group C in this\nstudy, but the rotational errors were significantly lower than those of the\nthree groups in this study. This difference may be because our study included\nDIBH patients, whereas the study of Kang et al. included FB patients. Another\nfactor may be the differences between different positional immobilization\ntechniques.\n\nComparisons of the time spent in non\u2010marker SGRT with the skin marker/tattoo\nset\u2010up have rarely been reported. Additionally, there have been significant\ninconsistencies in setup times, 19 ,  21 ,  32 ,  33 which may be related to\nthe fact that each radiotherapy unit entailed different positioning equipment,\noperating procedures, and technical standards.

Reactive oxygen\nspecies (ROS, e.g., superoxide \u2022O2\u2212, hydroxyl \u2022OH\u2212 and others), also known as\nfree radicals, are continuously produced by the body\u2019s regular use of oxygen,\nsuch as respiration and some cell-mediated immune functions [26]. ROS at\nphysiological concentrations are necessary for normal cell function. However,\nsuppose cellular constituents do not effectively scavenge ROS. In that case,\nexcess ROS can react with many biomolecules such as DNA [27], lipids [28], and\nproteins [29], initiating the peroxidation of membrane lipids, leading to the\naccumulation of lipid peroxides and the damage of DNA and proteins, and\nfinally resulting in disease conditions. Oleanolic acid probably generates its\nprotective effects mainly through antioxidant mechanisms, quenching ROS,\ninhibiting lipid peroxidation, or indirectly stimulating cellular antioxidant\ndefences [30].\n\nSeveral triterpenoid compounds and their derivatives have been shown to\ndemonstrate promising antioxidant properties in experimental and clinical\nstudies, mostly from the ursane, oleanane, and lupane groups (e.g.,\n[31,32,33,34]).\n\nIn this work, we present the results of the latest experimental work on the\nsynthesis of a new type of oleanolic acid derivatives named OADs (Oleanolic\nAcid Dimers), their cytostatic activity against SKBR-3 (human breast\nadenocarcinoma), SKOV-3 (human ovarian cystadenocarcinoma), PC-3 (human\nprostate carcinoma), and U-87 (human glioblastoma) cell lines, and their\nantioxidant activity.\n\n2\\.

Immunoprecipitation (IP)\nresults indicated that the knockdown of OTUD6B effectively enhanced the\nubiquitylation of PDLIM2, while overexpression of OTUD6B decreased the\nubiquitylation of PDLIM2 (Fig. 5F-G). The experimental results demonstrated\nthat overexpressing OTUD6B notably increased PDLIM2 protein levels in HCC\ncells. This increase could be counteracted by circPTPN12 knockdown.\nConversely, reducing OTUD6B levels led to a decrease in PDLIM2 protein levels,\nand this effect was enhanced by ectopic circPTPN12 expression (Fig. 5H-I). Co-\nIP assays and western blotting indicated that the ubiquitination of PDLIM2,\nhindered by OTUD6B overexpression, was notably reduced by circPTPN12\nknockdown. Conversely, reducing OTUD6B levels and further enhancing the\nubiquitination of PDLIM2 was observed upon circPTPN12 overexpression (Fig.\n5J-K). Meanwhile, circPTPN12 did not affect the levels of OTUD6B itself (Fig.\n5L). These findings indicate that circPTPN12 acts as a scaffold between PDLIM2\nand OTUD6B, promoting their interaction and preventing the ubiquitination of\nPDLIM2.

Based on the MS results binding upstream and downstream flanking\nsequences of circPTPN12 (Table.

In order to assess\nthe significance of ESRP1-binding sequences in the formation of circPTPN12, we\nconducted a search for GGT-rich sequences, known as ESRP1-binding motifs [27],\nwithin the flanking intronic regions of circPTPN12. This exploration led to\nthe identification of five potential ESRP1-binding sites (Fig. 6A).\nSubsequently, we generated wild-type and mutant circPTPN12 minigenes for the\npurpose of conducting a RIP assay. Our findings revealed that ESRP1 exhibited\nbinding affinity specifically to the putative wild-type binding sites situated\nwithin the flanking introns, while showing no affinity towards the mutant\nsites (Fig. 6B).

Src, PI3 Kinase, or Akt Inhibition Can Reduce Lipid Accumulation in\nPNPLA3-Depleted iPSC-Hepatocytes\n\nWe reasoned that a compound\u2019s ability to impact lipid levels would be more\nlikely to be bona fide if multiple compounds were identified that targeted\ninteracting pathways. Therefore, we performed bioinformatics analyses using\nSTITCH and found that inhibitors of Src, PI3K, and Akt formed an interactome\n(Figure 3F) [36].\n\nWe purchased new aliquots of each compound targeting Src, PI3K, and Akt to\nreduce the possibility of artifacts originating from the library. We also\nrationalized that if multiple compounds with shared modes of action yielded\nsimilar outcomes, it would increase the confidence in our conclusions.\nTherefore, we added the PI3K inhibitor LY 294002 and the Akt inhibitor\nMK-2206, which were not present in the original library.\n\nMultiple inhibitors targeting each pathway were then tested in eight-point\ndose-response assays on hepatocytes derived from PNPLA3\u22061/\u22062 (PP1, PP2,\nLY294002, PI828, MK-2206, and API-2; Figure 4A\u2013C and Supplementary Figure S4).\nA representative subset of compounds that targeted each pathway (PP1,\nLY294002, and MK-2206; Supplementary Figure S5) was also tested in\nPNPLA3I148M/M iPSC-derived hepatocytes. All tested compounds reduced the\nnumber of lipid droplets in both cell genotypes, although their efficacies\nvaried. Inhibition of Src by inhibitors PP1 and PP2 reduced droplet levels\nonly modestly by approximately 50%. In contrast, LY294002 and PI828, which are\ninhibitors of PI3K, and Akt inhibitors MK-2206 and API-2 almost eradicated the\npresence of lipid droplets (Figure 4A,C). We also tested the effect of the\ncompounds on cell viability to ensure that any decrease in lipid droplet\naccumulation was not due to cell death. As expected, at high doses, most\ncompounds affected cell viability, albeit modestly (Figure 4B). However, each\ninhibitor also effectively reduced lipid droplet accumulation at doses that\nhad no significant impact on cell survival (Figure 4B).

First, anti-PD-1 blocks immune checkpoint molecules by binding\nto the PD-L1 receptor on tumor cells. Second, anti-CD40 will direct exosomes\nto target the CD40 receptor on the membrane of dendritic cells (DC). After DC\nreceives a positive costimulatory signal, exosomes will be taken up by DC and\nrelease cGAMP through lysosome-mediated exosome permeability to produce type I\ninterferon (IFN-I) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The two activation of\ndendritic cells (DCs) and the blocking of PD-L1 in tumor cells have improved\nthe efficacy of combined cancer immunotherapy for tumor suppression (350). In\naddition to the use of dual agents, chimeric peptide exosomes are also a novel\nstrategy for therapy, Cheng et al. engineered with chimeric peptides for dual\nplasma membrane and nuclear targeting photosensitizer delivery and synergistic\nphotodynamic therapy (PDT), engineered chimeric peptide exosomes (ChiP-Exo)\ncan achieve membrane targeting and, to some extent, lead to cell death, as the\npresence of nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptides can also enhance\nnuclear delivery. Nuclear ChiP-Exo activates reactive oxygen species (ROS) in\nsitu to disrupt the nucleus, resulting in stable and synergistic PDT. This\nexosome-based dual-stage light-guided subcellular dual-target PDT strategy has\nshown greatly enhanced therapeutic effects in inhibiting tumor growth,\nproviding new ideas for the development of individualized biomedicine for\nprecise tumor treatment (351). Similarly, Trivedi et al. used dual-targeted\nhyaluronic acid nanoparticles to manipulate exosome contents by gene\ntransfection into tumor cells.

In one study, researchers reported that DTH\n(3,4-divanillyltetrahydrofuran) extract from UD roots was more cytotoxic to\nLNCaP cells than PC3 cells due to their differences in androgen sensitivity\n[53]. UD was also shown to inhibit the proliferation of PC3 prostate cancer\ncells by inducing a G2/M cell cycle arrest, hence halting the cell cycle\nprogression at a critical checkpoint during cell division [50].\n\nAnother mechanism for the anticancer effects of UD is the activation of the\nprogrammed apoptotic cell death mechanism. The molecular mechanisms through\nwhich UD extracts exhibit their anticancer activity range from reactive oxygen\nspecies (ROS) production, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA damage to\nproapoptotic caspase cleavage. UD extracts were proven to promote DNA\nfragmentation, one of the most fundamental aspects of apoptosis, in both PC3\nand LNCaP cancer cells [50,51]. Additionally, studies indicated that UD\nextract activates the cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), a protein\ninvolved in DNA repair, in the aforementioned prostate cancer cells [51,54].\nAnother hallmark of apoptosis is mitochondrial depolarization, which is\ncharacterized by increased permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and the\nrelease of cytochrome c, a caspase-9 activator, into the cytosol [55]. Levy\nand colleagues revealed in their study the ability of UD to decrease\nmitochondrial membrane potential in prostate cancer cells. Along with this,\nthe authors confirmed increased caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity upon UD\nexposure, providing more evidence for the role of apoptosis in prostate cancer\ncell death [51], similar to another study that demonstrated an upregulated\nmRNA expression for both caspase 3 and caspase 9 in PC3 cells treated with UD\n[50]. Moreover, UD promoted inhibitory effects on the expression of the\nantiapoptotic marker Bcl-2, a protein that reduces the permeability of the\nmitochondrial membrane and inhibits the release of cytochrome c [50,56].\nLastly, the current literature indicates that there is a link between\ndecreased mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS production, and apoptosis in\ncancer cells [57,58]. In the study conducted by Levy et al., the authors\nconcluded that apoptosis activation, revealed by an increase in apoptotic\nmarkers along with DNA fragmentation and membrane depolarization, could be due\nto the accumulation of ROS in these cells upon exposure to UD as compared to\nthe control group [51].\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no in vivo studies have been reported in the\nliterature evaluating the anticancer properties of UD on prostate cancer\ndespite the extensive in vitro studies conducted.

The study found that CTC-positive patients\n(CTCs \u2265 3) who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy had shorter OS than CTC-\nnegative patients who did not receive chemotherapy (68.1 months versus 82.0\nmonths). Chen et al. conducted a larger population study involving 277\nindividuals with stage II CRC and obtained more promising results [82]. They\nused EpCAM-independent subtraction enrichment with immunostaining-fluorescence\nin situ hybridization (SE-iFISH) to isolate and count CTCs. In their cohort,\npatients with a preoperative CTC count \u22654 had a significantly higher\nrecurrence risk than those with a preoperative CTC count <4\\. Moreover, if\ntheir CTC count was \u22654, patients showed a survival benefit if they received\npostoperative chemotherapy. More importantly, if a patient\u2019s CTC count was \u22654\nat more than three consecutive measurements (between 2 and 6 months), the\nrecurrence rate was 100% in this cohort. This study suggested that the\npersistent presence of CTCs in the blood is a risk factor for CRC recurrence\nin these special groups, and the possible role of the dynamic monitoring of\nCTCs is essential in CRC surveillance. Taken together, the detection of CTCs\nin stage II CRC patients suggested the clinical utility of these cells in\nintense follow-up strategies and decision-making regarding adjuvant\nchemotherapy, which can be used to evaluate and distinguish stage II CRC\npatients who need to receive adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n3.2. The Clinical Value of CTCs in Rectal Cancer Patients Who Undergo\nNeoadjuvant Chemotherapy\n\nAmong clinical cases, rectal cancer accounts for around 35% of the CRC\npopulation, but the treatment strategy is more complex due to its specific\nanatomy [22] compared to that of colon cancer. Among the previously mentioned\nstrategies for treating LARC, the most widely adopted strategy is neoadjuvant\nchemoradiotherapy (NCRT), followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. The\npurpose of neoadjuvant therapy is to shift part of the adjuvant treatment to\nbefore surgery. By following this approach, patients may benefit from better\ncompliance than they would with postoperative chemotherapy and earlier\ntreatment of micrometastatic disease to improve disease-free survival [22].\nAround 10\u201330% of patients benefit from pathological complete remission (pCR)\nafter NCRT, in which no residual tumor is detected in the specimen, which may\nfacilitate the avoidance of surgical resection [83]. However, because of tumor\nheterogenicity not only between different patients with the same disease but\nalso between cancer cells derived from the same tumor [23], only a few\npredictive markers have been applied in clinical practice to predict the\nresponse to neoadjuvant therapy beforehand [26]. The presence of CTCs or\npersistent CTCs detected after treatment (surgery) is a poor prognostic factor\nfor CRC patients. Therefore, monitoring CTCs might have potential in assessing\nthe therapeutic response of rectal cancer patients who undergo NCRT and\npredicting cancer recurrence in this specific group [84].\n\n3.2.1.

The MutS is a key protein in mismatch-\nspecific recognition that can identify methylated guanine-containing base\npairs and bind to locations between normal and methylated bases [88].\n\nTherefore, developing a method based on the MutS protein led to an increase in\nsensitivity and specificity of methylation detection [89]. This method has the\nadvantages of high sensitivity and specificity, speed, simplicity, and broad\napplicability. In this technique, after modifyingthe gDNA sample using sodium\nbisulfite, PCR amplification is performed with two pairs of specific primers\nfor unmethylated and methylated DNA. The MutS protein can bind to the mismatch\nsite (G/U) of the unmethylated conversion and primer complex in the following\nPCR amplification. The binding of MutS prevents DNA polymerase to this\ncomplex, so inhibiting the replication of unmethylated DNA. Therefore, this\nprotein can inhibit not only non-specific primer amplification but also the\nreplication of unmethylated DNA. Finally, gel electrophoresis analysis is\napplied to detect methylated and unmethylated fragments (Fig. 3) [90]. The\nstudy by Zhang et al. has argued that MB-MSP technology is an improved method\nfor detecting DNA methylation statute, has potential application value, and\npredicts early cancer diagnosis. They evaluated the methylation analysis of\nCLEC11A, SEPT9, and ACP1 genes in liver cancer samples by the MB-MSP method,\nwith a 1.5 h detection time and 0.5% detection limit [90].\n\nNGS-based amplicon sequencing (Next generation sequencing-based amplicon\nsequencing)\n\nThe amplicon-based bisulfite gDNA methylation method combines bisulfite\nconversion of gDNA with amplicons (targeted amplification of the regions of\ninterest), the sequencing library, and next-generation sequencing (NGS). This\nmethod provides quantitative DNA methylation with genome-wide analysis and\nsingle-base pair resolution [91]. At the start of the workflow, gDNA is\ntreated with sodium bisulfite, then the converted DNA is amplified using the\nPCR process twice. In the first PCR, the gene-specific primer carries the\namplicons for the second PCR. In the second PCR, the products are reamplified\nwith specific adaptor primers attached to the amplicon sequences. Afterward,\nthe appropriate library can be applied for sequencing and following data\nanalysis (Fig. 3) [92, 93].\n\nRecently, da Silva et al. assessed MLH1 promoter methylation in colorectal\ncancer with an NGS-based amplicon sequencing method.

This study\nshowed that NGS-based amplicon sequencing has great specificity and\nsensitivity to detect MLH1 methylation in CRC patients.\n\nConclusion\n\nDNA methylation analysis has provided a comprehensive overview of the\nrelationship between human cancer and epigenetic changes. The functional\neffect of aberrant DNA methylation and the extensive changes in DNA\nmethylation in cancer development have led to the expansion of various\ntechniques to describe methylation patterns.

Jaclyn Sceneay\net al. found that compared with young mice and young patients with triple-\nnegative breast cancer, aged mice and aged patients showed decreased IFN\nsignaling with age; STING agonist could significantly improve response to\nimmune checkpoint blockade therapy in aged mice, but no additive effect of\nSTING agonist in young mice, although STING agonist could also activate IFN\nsignaling in young mice 33. Antonio Marzio et al. showed that mutations in\nKEAP1 induces stabilization of EMSY, which was responsible for the suppression\nof IFN signaling and immune evasion in non-small cell lung cancer; STING\nagonist could inhibit the growth of KEAP1-mutant tumors, but not\nKEAP1-widetype tumors 31. It seems that tumors with defective IFN pathway\ndisplayed a sensitivity to STING agonism due to an engagement of anti-tumor\nimmune signaling in the tumor microenvironment. If the tumor does not have a\ndefective IFN pathway, it would not appear to be a vulnerability in this tumor\ntype. The effects of ADU-S100 on anti-tumor immunity and tumor growth\ninhibition were further validated in the humanized mouse model bearing human\nHerceptin-resistant SKBR3 cells. Thus, these results suggested that the\nsuppression of cGAS-STING pathway was the key factor in the immune escape of\nHerceptin-resistant tumor, and could be rescued by stimulating type I IFNs\nwith STINGa.\n\nClinical trials have confirmed DS-8201 as the standard of care for HER2+ BC\npatients with Herceptin resistance 3. As a large proportion of Herceptin-\nresistant HER2+ BC patients are still refractory and not sensitive to\nHER2-targeting therapy, identifying novel combination strategies is a major\npriority 6. The mechanism of action of DS-8201 includes Antibody-dependent\ncell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and DNA damage induced by topoisomerase I\ninhibition. Since ADCC requires a suitable tumor immune microenvironment and\nDNA damage would exert anti-tumor effects by activating innate immunity, the\nsuppressive immune microenvironment with impaired innate immune system may\nreduce the anti-tumor effect of DS-8201. We proposed that stimulating IFN\nsignaling with STINGa may be a good strategy to compensate for defective\ninnate immune signaling in Herceptin-resistant HER2+ BC and have a synergistic\nanti-tumor effect with DS-8201. Surprisingly, in the co-culture experiment\nwith PBMCs, though no additional effect of ADU-S100 was observed in parental\ncells when combining with DS-8201, the combination of DS-8201 with ADU-S100\ncould increase the death of cancer cells significantly compared to DS-8201\nalone in resistant cells in vitro. In humanized mouse model, the anti-tumor\nefficacy of combination of DS-8201 with ADU-S100 was significantly better than\nthat of each single drug. Therefore, HER2+ BC with Herceptin resistance may\nbenefit from a combination strategy including DS-8201 and IFN signaling\nactivation with STINGa.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, we clarified a novel immune-related index (IRPI) for the prognosis\nof HER2+ BC patients with Herceptin treatment. We elucidated that cGAS-STING\npathway is the key determinant of immune escape in Herceptin-resistant BC with\nhigh IRPI.

Because of the dual effect of senescent cells in cancer therapy, a\ntwo-step therapeutic approach has been proposed, in which radiation and\nchemotherapy induce senescence (with anticancer effects) and, subsequently,\nsenescent cells are selectively cleared, to minimize tumor fueling [35].

{"id": "PMC11246281-0", "context": "Introduction\n\nThe tumor microenvironment (TME) consists of a diverse combination of\nchemicals and cells that surround tumor cells as a multifaceted organ composed\nof non-cancerous stromal cells, blood vessels, lymphatic vessels,\nextracellular matrix (ECM) and secretory proteins [1, 2]. A major part of\nstromal cells in TME includes immune cells and substances such as dendritic\ncells, natural killer (NK) cells, regulatory T cells and macrophages scattered\nin the cancerous mass. The functions and roles of these compounds are\ndifferent based on the degree and category of tumor progression [3].\n\nMacrophages are a type of versatile immune cells responsible for regulating\ntissue homeostasis, fighting infections, and contributing to wound healing and\nother functions. Although it is now widely accepted that most macrophages\noriginate from monocytes, the exact origin of macrophages is unclear because\ntissue-resident macrophages such as alveolar macrophages in the lungs, brain\nmicroglia, and Kupffer cells in the liver are not derived from blood monocytes\nand substitute for the origin mechanisms self-renewal and proliferation of\nthese cells have not been identified [4].\n\nMacrophages are the most abundant immune cells in the TME and after\ninfiltrating into tumor mass, they are referred to as tumor-associated\nmacrophages (TAMs) [5]. The normal function of TAMs is to suppress tumor\nformation. This function is mediated through different mechanisms, including\ndirect phagocytosis of tumor cells, the induction of T cell-mediated cell\ncytotoxicity and the stimulation of antibody-mediated immune response. This\ntype of TAMs is usually referred to as M1-type. However, tumor cells can evade\nthe antineoplastic properties of TAMs through different mechanisms. For\nexample, the cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47), known as the \u201cdo-not-eat-\nme\u201d signal is widely expressed on the membrane of tumor cells. The ligand of\nCD47, signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP\u03b1), is mainly expressed on\nmacrophages and when the interaction with CD47 occurs, the downstream\nsignaling within tumor cells results in the dephosphorylation of multiple\nsubstrates, keeping tumor cells from phagocytosis by macrophages [6]. After\nevading phagocytosis, tumor cells can further recruit TAMs to help them better\nproliferate and disseminate throughout the body. This second type of TAMs with\ncompromised characteristic is called M2-type [7].\n\nM1 cells typically respond to harmful signals sent by interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and\nexhibit heightened expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS),\nreactive oxygen species (ROS), and interleukin 12 (IL-12), which primarily\npossess antitumor effects and aid in distinguishing tumor cells from normal\ncells [8, 9]. On the other hand, M2 macrophages express high levels of VEGF,\nIL-10, IL-1\u03b2, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which contribute to\nchemoresistance, tumor angiogenesis and metastasis [10, 11] (Fig. 1). The\naccumulation of M2-type TAMs is often linked to a poor prognosis in human\ncancers including lung, breast, and gastric cancers [12, 13].Fig. 1\n\nThe transition between M1 and M2 TAMs. The normal function of TAMs is to\nsuppress tumor formation, which is mediated through different mechanisms,\nincluding direct phagocytosis of tumor cells, the induction of T cell-mediated\n\n", "question": "What are the characteristics of M2-type tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)?", "answer": "M2-type TAMs express high levels of VEGF, IL-10, IL-1\u03b2, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which contribute to chemoresistance, tumor angiogenesis and metastasis."}

Meanwhile,\nalthough the acute fate of cancer cells trapped by the omentum was not\ninvestigated in this study, the consequence of rapid sequestration of cancer\ncells into the omentum still has the potential to revolutionize OvCa\ntreatment. Despite efforts in improving therapeutics against OvCa, one of the\ngreatest predictors of prognosis in stage III and IV patients is still the\nmaximal removal of tumors during cytoreduction surgery (Bristow et al., 2023).\nBecause most OvCa patients will undergo omentectomy as part of treatment,\npreoperative intraperitoneal administration of \u03b2-glucan could potentially\nimprove surgical outcomes by trapping fluid cancer cells in the organ prior to\nits removal.

More recently, accumulating evidence\ndemonstrates the role of IL27 in promoting expansion of regulatory T cells (Do\net al., 2017; Hall et al., 2012), expression of T cell checkpoint receptors\n(Carbotti et al., 2015; Hirahara et al., 2012), and survival of tumor cells\n(Jia et al., 2016), revealing its context-dependent role in modulating tumor\nimmunity. This starkly contrasts to IL12, which is universally considered to\nbe antitumor. IL12 is strongly induced by PAMP/IFN\u03b3 stimulation in vitro and\nis a hallmark of antitumor M\u03a6s. Recent in vivo work has demonstrated that co-\nstimulation of M\u03a6s by MPLA (a PAMP molecule, acting as a TLR4 agonist) and\nIFN\u03b3 in breast cancer and OvCa induces IL12 production by M\u03a6s and promotes\nantitumor T cell activity (Sun et al., 2021). However, the serious toxicity of\nIL12 in humans prevented its clinical usage (Leonard et al., 1997). To this\nend, IL27 could be a promising cytokine that stimulates local rather than\nsystemic antitumor immunity. Interestingly, in published human and our own\nmouse scRNA-seq datasets of OvCa, expression of IL12 was not highly induced\n(Figure S4C & S4F), suggesting that different tumor microenvironments can\ninduce differential antitumor cytokine-secretion in M\u03a6s. These suggest that\nIL27 is a promising antitumor cytokine in treating metastatic OvCa. Whether\nIL27 is a viable therapeutic target in OvCa requires future investigations.\nFinally, as to the regulation of IL27 expression and secretion, we found that\nboth agents in BI treatment were required to stimulate IL27 heterodimer\nsecretion in vitro.

However, there are two types of AKT activation.\nFull activation of AKT needs its phosphorylation at two sites including the\nactivation loop (T308 for AKT1), and the C\u2010terminus region (S473 for AKT1).\nPartial activation of AKT occurs when AKT is phosphorylated at T308 by\n3\u2032\u2010phosphoinositide\u2010dependent kinase\u20101 (PDK\u20101), whose activity is also\nregulated by PI3K with the production of PIP3. 35\n\nIn addition to PI3K\u2010mediated AKT activation, there are several other\nmechanisms in a PI3K\u2010independent manner.

These autophagosomes are\nresponsible for transporting and capturing cellular content in the manner of\nphagocytosis, eventually leading to lysosomal degradation. In the initial\nphage of selective and non\u2010selective autophagy, both ULK activation and\nphosphatidylinositol 3\u2010phosphate generation are pre\u2010requisite for lysosomal\ndegradation, which is followed by the cooperation of membrane vesicles.\nLysosome\u2010related degradation pathways are subsequently activated by virtue of\ncatabolic enzymes through combination of autophagosomes and lysosomes.\nActually, autophagy was defined as a survival resistance against external\nstarvation, whereas the latest assumption that autophagy is hyperactive in\nmost cells has been proved to degrade the cellular cargo under multiple\nstimulations.\n\nAs advancements in the field of autophagy continue, a more precise concept\nknown as selective autophagy (one of the major forms of autophagy) has\nrecently shown an enhanced research upsurge. The selective autophagic\nprocesses have been verified to target specific multicellular organelles for\nfurther cargo degradation, such as endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria,\nperoxisomes, as well as proteasomes or protein aggregates.

Thus, despite the abundance of immune cells\npresent in bone, the distinctive cytokine profile may shift the balance\ntowards an immune-excluded TIME.\n\nClinical evidence supports the hypothesis that local anatomic regions of\ntumour growth influences the TIME composition (27). Previous studies\nevaluating organ specific responses to ICIs have identified the greatest\nresponse rates in lymph node metastases and poorest in liver metastases (28,\n36, 45). Similar to the bone TIME, the liver appears to have distinct immune\ntolerance through multiple mechanisms including activation of Tregs and CD4- T\ncell death, affecting local and systemic tumour immunity (36). In melanoma,\nthe presence of liver metastases has been associated with fewer tumour\ninfiltrating lymphocytes, both at the liver lesion and at other distant\nmetastases (46). Lymph nodes, however, are consistently responsive to ICI\nacross studies, perhaps owing to the role of tumour-draining lymph nodes in\npriming antigen-specific responses to PD-1 blockade (47). Early bone response\nto ICI has been significantly correlated with visceral disease control (37).\nUsing the MD Anderson criteria, Nakata et al. identified a 40% response rate\nof BoMs amongst 15 patients treated with nivolumab, and osteosclerotic bone\nresponse within three months of starting ICI treatment was predictive of\nfavourable outcomes (37).

Multiple modes of action of GPER described above\nhave overlapping signaling pathways that mediate independent rapid\nintracellular signal transduction.\n\nApart from GPER, G\u03b1q-ER and ER-X are newly discovered mERs, and the mechanism\nof signal transduction is not fully understood. Estrogen activates G\u03b1q by\nbinding to the receptor, then activates PLC and hydrolyzes PIP2 out of DAG to\nactivate PKC, which subsequently activates cAMP and PKA, finally opening the\npotassium channel of the membrane to induce corresponding biological effects\n(Qiu Jronnekleiv and Kelly, 2008). Studies suggest that ER-X-mediated estrogen\nregulation involves the MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, and activation of ERK1\nand ERK2, which is important for neuronal survival and growth.\n\n4 Role of estrogen and ERs in PCOS\n\nEstrogen and ERs exert a variety of physiological activities, including\nreproductive, immune, cardiovascular, endocrine, aging, and neurological\ndiseases. The abnormal expression of estrogen and ERs is closely related to\nPCOS in various aspects.\n\n4.1 Role of estrogen and ERs in the endometrium of PCOS\n\nThe endometrial changes in patients with PCOS vary with the level of estrogen\nsecreted by the ovaries (Palomba Spiltonen and Giudice, 2021). When the\nfollicles always develop immaturely, and the ovaries continue to secrete a\nsmall amount of estrogen. The endometrium of patients with PCOS is impaired\nprogesterone response (Albaghdadi and Kan, 2021; Hamza et al., 2021). The\nendometrium without progesterone undergoes different degrees of hyperplasia,\neven the occurrence of endometrial cancer. Studies have been made to detect\nthe expression levels of ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 in the endometrium of patients with PCOS.\nResults showed that the expression of ER\u03b1 mRNA and protein in the endometrium\nof patients with PCOS was higher than that of normal women. However the\nexpression of ER\u03b2 was not significantly changed, suggesting that the\nsensitivity of PCOS intimal to estrogen stimulation is increased (Quezada et\nal., 2006).

Consistent with published literature\nindicating DNA methylation restricted CTCF binding [32, 33], signal profiles\nrevealed noticeable decrease of DNA methylation on CTCF_up peaks in KO\n(Additional file 2: Fig. S4I, top). Meanwhile, on CTCF_down peaks, DNA\nmethylation remained largely unchanged (Additional file 2: Fig. S4I, bottom).\nTaken together, these findings suggest that increased CTCF binding in KO was\ndue to increased chromatin accessibility and DNA hypomethylation.\n\nFollowing these observations, we looked deeper into the accumulative signal of\nCTCF ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, H3K9me3 ChIP-seq, and DNA methylation on CTCF_up_B2\nelements in both WT and KO (Fig. 4D-H). These B2 elements exhibited moderate\nenrichment of CTCF occupancy in WT, which increased in KO as anticipated (Fig.\n4D). In parallel, chromatin accessibility mirrored this trend (Fig. 4E).\nInterestingly, the repressive epigenetic markers showed a similar trend but\nexhibited distinct patterns. For H3K9me3, a notable enrichment (\u201cpeak\u201d) was\nobserved on CTCF_up_B2 in WT, which was almost completely diminished in KO\n(Fig. 4F). In contrast, DNA methylation was below the background (\u201cvalley\u201d) on\nCTCF_up_B2 in WT, and the signal was further reduced in KO (Fig. 4G). These\nobservations suggest that H3K9me3 and DNA methylation both contribute to the\nrepression of CBS on SINE_B2 elements.\n\nCTCF is a highly conserved zinc finger protein and plays an important role in\nthe regulation of gene transcription [34\u201336]. CTCF occupancy is broadly\ndistributed across the genome. Density plot illustrated that a considerable\nproportion of CTCF peaks were located on gene promoters (around TSS), while\nthe remaining peaks were concentrated around 16 Kb away from the TSS (Fig.\n4I). We noticed that CTCF_up peaks were almost exclusively absent from the\npromoter regions (Fig. 4I). This was in line with the fact that the observed\nCTCF_up peaks were largely located on SINE_B2 elements (Fig. 4B, Additional\nfile 2: Fig. S4C-E), which showed a significant enrichment in non-promoter\nregions (Additional file 2: Fig. S4J), suggesting an indirect mechanism such\nas CTCF-mediated chromatin interactions in gene regulation.\n\nReorganization of chromatin loops on SINE_B2 with increased CTCF binding after\nSetdb1 ablation\n\nIn recent years, CTCF has been extensively studied for its pivotal role in\nmaintaining 3D genome architecture through the mediation of chromatin folding\n[34\u201336]. Therefore, we explored the influences of genome-wide increased CTCF\nbinding on chromatin organization in KO NPCs. We performed in situ Hi-C in\nbiological triplicates and generated Hi-C contact maps with a resolution of <\n15 Kb for individual samples, and < 5 Kb for merged samples by genotype\n(Additional file 2: Fig. S5A).

Various commercial tools,\nkits, and reagents exist for this technique, such as the Ficoll-Hypaque and\nOncoQuick systems. These devices help separate CTCs through centrifugation in\na medium containing a porous partition and an appropriate density gradient\n(72). The ApoStream system captures CTCs using dielectrophoresis field-flow\nfractionation (DEP-FFF) within a microfluidic chamber (73). In recent years, a\nnumber of microfluidic chip-based cell separation systems have been\nintroduced, including the Parsortix (74), ClearCell FX (75), and VTX-1 (76).\nFor example, the Parsortix is a microfluidic device that doesn\u2019t rely on\nspecific epitopes. It uses tiny stepped structures that get progressively\nnarrower to target rare cells based on size and deformability (74). The\nClearCell FX system has shown it can recover more than 60% of the NCI-H1650\nlung cancer cells added to blood samples (75). Zhu et al. have introduced a\nnovel approach to address the low purity and potential cell damage associated\nwith ex vivo CTC separation techniques. By adhering engineered RBCs to CTCs to\ncreate CTC-RBC complexes, they achieved over 90% capture efficiency and over\n75% purity (82). Additionally, using autologous RBCs bound to CTCs (CC-RBCs),\nthey leveraged differences in optical properties to separate modified CTCs in\nan optofluidic system with a laser, resulting in a purity above 92% and a\nrecovery rate exceeding 90%, while maintaining the CTCs\u2019 membrane integrity\nand function (83).\n\nEx vivo separation and enrichment methods based on biological properties\ninclude both positive and negative enrichment. The CellSearch system, which\nincludes immunomagnetic separation based on EpCAM, followed by\nimmunofluorescent imaging and detection of epithelial-derived CTCs, was the\nfirst to receive FDA approval for clinical use. However, it may not capture\nCTCs that are undergoing EMT (77, 84).

Successfully inhibiting ferroptosis\nexclusively in healthy tissues will be the most important goal for drug\ndevelopment.

However, the relative contributions of each type of cell\ndeath are challenging to quantify. Select studies have compared the relative\nsurvival advantage of irradiated tissues that have been administered\ninhibitors of individual forms of cell death.

However, ferroptosis is a\ncomplex and incompletely understood process, thus monotherapy inhibitors are\nunlikely to accurately estimate its total burden on irradiated tissues.\nSimilarly, overlap exists between mediators of different cell death pathways,\nfurther complicating the ability to identify relative individual contributions\n[52, 93, 105]. Regardless, the proportional degree by which apoptosis,\nferroptosis, pyroptosis, or other processes are responsible for IR-induced\ncell death remains an intriguing area for future research. Importantly,\nunderstanding differences in the relative role of ferroptosis among other\nforms of cell death in healthy and malignant tissue may elucidate therapeutic\nmethods to improve both the safety and efficacy of radiotherapy.\n\nConclusion\n\nFerroptosis is universally involved in IR-induced injury across several\ncommonly affected organs. Inhibiting each of the hallmarks of ferroptosis may\nbe effective at mitigating organ injury following IR exposure. However, the\nprecise mechanisms of ferroptosis and the role of IR in its induction require\nfurther investigation, which will inform future therapeutic development.\n\n", "question": "What is the role of ferroptosis in radiation-induced tissue injury?", "answer": "Ferroptosis is universally involved in IR-induced injury across several commonly affected organs."}

To investigate if ATO acts similarly, we pretreated cells\nwith the ROS-scavenging antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). As shown in Fig.\n6A, NAC pretreatment restored the growth of cells across all 3 cell lines.\nUsing flow cytometric analysis, we showed that ATO increased ROS levels\nfollowing 8 h of treatment (Fig. 6B). However, at 24 h, there was no increase\nin ROS levels in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 6C). In comparison, the increased level of\nROS was sustained at 24 h in the two p53 mutant lines, MDA-MB-468 and BT-549\n(Fig. 6C). Treatment with NAC reduced levels of the reactive oxygen species to\nconcentrations similar to that in the control samples.Fig. 6\n\nEffect of ATO on ROS production.

Consistent with its ability to\nreactivate mutant p53 [15], we show that ATO was more potent in inhibiting\nproliferation in mutant TP53 cell lines than in wild-type TP53 cell lines. A\npotentially important result from a clinical perspective was our finding that\nthe anti-proliferative response to ATO was significantly greater in TN than in\nnon-TN cell lines. This is potentially of great relevance given the relative\npaucity of clinically exploited molecular targets in this subtype of breast\ncancer. We have previously reported similar findings for other mutant p53\nreactivating compounds, APR-246 and COTI-2 [18,28]. Our results also show that\nthe anti-proliferative effect of ATO is higher on cancer cell lines compared\nto the non-tumorigenic cell line, MCF-10A. Consistent with our findings, Smith\net al. [33] previously reported that high exposure to inorganic arsenic in\ndrinking water resulted in a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality.\nThese authors also found that ATO induced apoptosis and reduced viability in 4\nbreast cancer cell lines. However, in contrast to our work, the mechanism of\naction of ATO was not investigated in that study.\n\nAs mentioned above, Chen et al.

Overcoming such challenges relies upon\ntechnological advances in their detection, of which there have been an\nabundance in recent years. RTq-PCR was rapidly accepted by the scientific\ncommunity as a means of quantifying miRNA, after first being described in\npublished works by Chen et al. [57]. It is now deemed as an orthogonal and\ngold-standard approach for validating miRNA expression differences within\nsample sets. However, due to limitations of this approach, including RNA-\nsensitivity, specificity and cross-reactivity, and normalisation, other\ntechniques are now becoming established as validation approaches when\nexploring miRNA detection and profiling. One technique, NanoString\u2019s nCounter\u00ae\nmicroRNA assay, was reported as having advantages in terms of improved\nsensitivity and specificity over conventional techniques (such as RTq-PCR)\nwithin a pioneering paper in 2014 by Mestdagh et al. [58], a finding that has\nbeen further supported within the literature [59, 60]. The technology works\nwithout relying upon reverse transcription or amplification and is capable of\nhighly multiplexed analysis of samples. This is achieved via direct digital\ndetection of RNA or DNA molecules of interest using colour-coded pairs of\nprobes (capture and reporter) which hybridise to the target molecules. The\nhigh-throughput approach facilitates reliable and reproducible expression\nprofiling of up to 800 genes in a single assay, with input biomarker molecules\nas low as 1 ng (RNA). Another well-reported sensing technology is that of Next\nGeneration RNA sequencing (RNAseq) as utilised in the previously discussed\nstudy conducted by Kopkova et al. [56]. RNAseq, developed upon classic Sanger\nsequencing, offers a parallel sequencing by synthesis (SBS) approach that has\nmany advantages over other sequencing approaches. Not only does it offer large\ndata outputs (300 kb up to multiple terabases/run) but has high sensitivity,\nquantitative precision, as well as the ability to screen a high number of\nsamples in parallel (high throughput in nature) [61]. However, despite this\nthere are some challenges associated when applying this technology to miRNA\nscreening. These include misannotation of novel or underexpressed miRNA [62,\n63], sequencing biases based on library preparation protocol variations, and\nextensive sample processing [64]. As a means of circumnavigating some of these\nchallenges new technologies are being developed within the scientific\ncommunity. Recently, Cai et al. [65] reported a molecular probe-based system\nthat allows for amplification-free multiplexed detection of microRNAs within\nunprocessed biofluid samples. This electro-optical sensing platform functions\nvia custom probes combining a DNA carrier and molecular beacon labelled with a\nreversible fluorophore and quencher in a hairpin structure which upon binding\nto the miRNA-target unhinges and restores fluorescence. The DNA-carrier acts\nas a barcode with its length resulting in differential electrical signal upon\nnanopore (nanopipette) detection. This technology displayed femtomolar\nsensitivity thus supporting detection of sub-nanomolar concentrations of\nmiRNAs within biofluids without the need of amplification steps, and single-\nbase mismatch selectivity essential for discriminating between miRNA\u2019s high\nhomology due to their short sequence length, on unprocessed blood serum\nsamples obtained from Prostate Cancer patients.

The\nmARS component AIMp1 enhances TH1 immunity when released and secreted. Kim et\nal. demonstrated that mice treated with a DNA adjuvant encoding a fusion\nprotein that linked an anti-CD3 single chain Fv to AIMp1 significantly\nupregulated TH1 immune responses as characterized by increased IFN-\u03b3\nproduction in CD4+ T-cells and increased levels of IgG2a with concomitant\nfunctional inhibition of TH2 immunity (81). Interestingly, a contrasting study\nsuggested that in CD4+ T-cells, AIMp1 may drive T regulatory cell\ndifferentiation rather than TH1 immune responses (82). Here, AIMp1 inhibited\nT-cell receptor (TCR)-dependent activation by reducing lipid raft association\nin AIMp1 treated cells. Accordingly, the reduced lipid raft association\nlimited the formation of TCR-centered molecular activation clusters and\ndownstream activation (82). TCR stimuli-induced calcium influx was then\nreduced in addition to phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules PLC\u03b3\nand PI3K when CD4+ T-cells were cultured in presence of AIMp1 (82).

Febrifugine, a bioactive compound in\nmany Chinese medicinal herbs mediates its tolerogenic effects by inhibiting\nthe pro-TH17 function of ProRS. Halofuginone (HF), a derivative of\nfebrifugine, competes with proline for binding to the ProRS tRNA binding site,\nleading to the accumulation of uncharged tRNApro. The accumulation of tRNApro\nactivates the amino acid response pathway (AAR) characterized by GCN2\nautophosphorylation and induction of the AAR-response gene DIT3. DIT3\nregulates cellular responses to stress including inhibition of TH17\ndifferentiation (83, 84). The inhibitory effects of halofuginone on ProRS can\nbe reversed by supplementation of proline or GluProRS (83, 84). Indeed,\ntreatment with HF has been shown to reverse TH17-mediated multiple sclerosis\nin mouse models (83). Further, GluProRS also may join the GAIT complex\nfollowing its release from the mARS and regulate the expression of\nproinflammatory genes (58).

ILD has been studied using breath\nwith promising results, but there is currently a lack of large validation\nstudies to progress the findings into a clinically useful test (van der Sar et\nal., 2023). A recent study (n = 157) analyzed the breath of subjects diagnosed\nwith IPF, connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-\nILD), and controls (Plantier et al., 2022). In this study, 34 VOCs were\nidentified that could distinguish IPF patients from control patients (84.6%\naccuracy), and a subset of 16 VOCs could distinguish IPF from CTD-ILD\n(accuracy 76.9%). The putatively identified VOCs that contributed the most to\nthe differences between IPF and controls were benzaldehyde which increased in\nIPF patient\u2019s breath, and ethanol, heptane, dimethyl sulfide, and an unknown\ncompound that all decreased in IPF patient\u2019s breath. A key observation in this\nstudy was that dimethyl sulfide decreased in IPF whereas the levels of\ndimethyl sulfone increased. Dimethyl sulfone is formed through the oxidation\nof dimethyl sulfide by hydrogen peroxide, and hydrogen peroxide has previously\nbeen shown to be produced in significantly higher amounts in IPF through the\nactivation of NADPH oxidase 4 by transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) (Hecker\net al., 2009). The authors posit this mechanism as a potential link between\nIPF pathophysiology and VOC content of exhaled breath. The VOCs 2-heptanone\nand 4-pentan-1-ol were decreased in the breath of CTD-ILD patients compared to\nIPF, and healthy controls, indicating that these two VOCs might be\nspecifically related to CTD-ILD pathophysiology.

However,\nnone of these VOCs appeared to be shared between the VOCs that could\ndistinguish IPF and CTD-ILD in the study by Plantier et al., so the use of\ndifferent breath collection methodologies and analytical procedures may be\nsignificantly impacting the results (Plantier et al., 2022).\n\nLung cancer\n\nA review focused on breath VOC profiles in lung cancer highlighted that\ndifferent sample collection procedures, differences in ambient air in\ndifferent sampling locations, heterogeneity in patient biology, and analysis\nmethodology used are important factors contributing to highly heterogeneous\nresults (Wang et al., 2022). Recent papers have shown progress in this area\nusing both off-line and on-line (Janssens et al., 2020; Kort et al., 2020;\nKoureas et al., 2020), and a recent review reported 34 VOC candidate\nbiomarkers that have been reported in more than five studies (Schmidt et al.,\n2023). In particular, the process of lipid peroxidation producing specific\naldehydes, especially pentanal, hexanal, and heptanal, have been raised as\nrepeatably represented across the literature in breath VOC profiles of those\nwith lung cancer (Sutaria et al., 2022). However, despite the large amount of\nwork in this area, there are currently no clinically validated breath\nbiomarkers or tests suitable for lung cancer screening due to historical\nissues with standardization (Antoniou et al., 2019; Choueiry et al., 2022;\nKeogh & Riches, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"\n\n", "question": "What are the potential biomarkers for lung cancer screening?", "answer": "Pentanal, hexanal, and heptanal."}

This analysis revealed that oncogenic\nforms of NRAS, KRAS, and HRAS (HRASV12, KRAS V12, and NRASQ61K) activate the\nexpression of several genes including IkappaBalpha (I\u03baB\u03b1) kinase.

It is an hormone-dependent\ntumor, and increasing evidence suggests that endogenous estrogen plays a\ncrucial role in its development. Elevated levels of endogenous estrogen are\nconsidered one of the mechanisms for breast cancer incidence [111]. Equol, due\nto its similar chemical structure to 17-\u03b2 estradiol, exhibits estrogenic\nactivity and is known for its classic biological activity as an estrogen-like\ncompound [112]. Depending on the levels of endogenous estrogens in the body,\nequol can act as either an agonist or antagonist. It can bind to the ER and\nexert weak estrogenic effects or competitively bind with estradiol on nuclear\nERs to exhibit antiestrogenic effects, thereby maintaining stable hormone\nlevels within the body [113]. In a case-control study conducted by Lee et al.,\nit was reported for the first time that soy products could reduce the risk of\npremenopausal women developing breast cancer. This may be attributed to the\npresence of phytoestrogens in soy products [114]. A prospective study from\nJapan also found a correlation between regular consumption of foods rich in\nisoflavones and reduced risk of breast cancer incidence [6]. An\nepidemiological survey discovered a positive correlation between increased\nurinary equol levels in premenopausal women and decreased risk of breast\ncancer [115]. Furthermore, early exposure to soy products has been shown to\nlower breast tumor incidence. Several case-control studies have confirmed a\nsignificant negative association between childhood or adolescent soy intake\nand risk of developing breast cancer [116\u2013118]. However, several nested case-\ncontrol studies have found no significant association between soy isoflavone\nintake and breast cancer risk in Western populations [119, 120]. These\nepidemiological contradictory findings may be attributed to the earlier\nstudies\u2019 failure to distinguish between equol producers and non-producers.\nThis is because the anti-tumor effects of SI primarily depend on their\nmetabolite equol, which can only be produced by approximately 30% of Western\npopulations and 60% of Asian populations [39, 87].\n\nEquol\u2019s estrogenic activity has been extensively demonstrated in many in vitro\nstudies to inhibit the progression of breast cancer. It achieves this by\nbinding to ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and invasion\nof breast cancer cells, as well as inducing apoptosis [121]. Eun et al. found\nthat equol suppresses tumor cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis mediated\nby caspase activation cascade in breast cancer cells [19]. S-equol can also\ninduce CpG island demethylation within the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene promoters in\nMDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines, resulting in tumor inhibition\n[89]. However, there are also reports suggesting that low concentrations of\nequol can activate ERK1/2 to induce entry into the S phase for MCF-7 breast\ncancer cells, promoting tumor cell proliferation [122].

It possesses the highest estrogenic\nand antioxidant activities among all flavonoid metabolites. Due to its\nstructural similarity to 17-\u03b2-estradiol, equol exhibits estrogen-like activity\nand affinity for both ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2. Although endogenous estrogen has positive\neffects on human health, long-term exposure to exogenous estrogen is widely\nrecognized as a potential risk factor for various types of cancer [154].\nAromatase is an enzyme with significant physiological functions in the human\nbody, capable of catalyzing the conversion of androgens to estrogens.\nPhytoestrogens can reduce the risk of estrogen-dependent tumors by inhibiting\nthe activity of aromatase, thereby lowering the level of estrogen in the body\n[155]. According to a study in Japan, equol has been found to promote the\nexcretion of estradiol in female urine and regulate the level of estradiol in\nthe blood [156]. In addition, research by Mahalingam et al. indicates that\nequol can inhibit the production, action, and metabolism of sex steroid\nhormones, including endogenous estradiol, testosterone, androstenedione, and\nprogesterone, thereby inhibiting follicular growth and inducing follicular\natresia [157]. Integrating these research results, equol can have a positive\nimpact on reducing the risk of various tumors by inhibiting the activity of\naromatase. Additionally, equol can increase the activity of endogenous\nantioxidant enzymes to exert its antioxidant effects [158]. So far, research\non equol\u2019s anti-tumor effects has mainly focused on its estrogen-like activity\nand antioxidant properties; however, further investigation is needed to\nunderstand the specific mechanisms by which equol exerts inhibitory effects on\ndifferent types of tumors. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that equol\ndemonstrates stronger anti-tumor activity than its precursor SI and plays a\nsignificant role in preventing and treating various human cancers (as shown in\nFig. 2). Numerous epidemiological studies have found a negative correlation\nbetween higher concentrations of equol in the body and the risk of multiple\ncancers [127, 159]. Therefore, it is worth exploring how to increase\ncirculating levels of equol within the body. As widely known, foods rich in SI\nare the main source of equol production. However, SI primarily exist in an\ninactive glycoside form that can only be absorbed after being enzymatically\nconverted into bioavailable genistein [160]. Specific intestinal microbiota\nprovide key enzymes for equol metabolism; however, only a few bacterial\nstrains involved in equol metabolism have been reported so far. Moreover,\nthere are variations in how different bacteria metabolize equol. Further\nresearch on the role of intestinal microbiota in equol metabolism will help us\nbetter understand their crucial contribution to this process. Therefore, it is\ncrucial to increase the intake of soy-based foods and enhance the abundance of\nindividual gut bacteria strains that produce equol. However, the intestinal\nmicrobiota in the human body is highly dynamic and constantly changes with\ndiet, age, and antibiotic use [161]. Therefore, the rational use of\nantibiotics and the development of probiotics containing equol-metabolizing\nbacterial strains would be beneficial in preventing and treating related\ndiseases by altering the composition of the\n\n", "question": "What is the role of aromatase in the body?", "answer": "Aromatase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogens.

In a\nhumanized immune system mouse model, CAR-macrophages were found to highly\nexpress MHC-II at the tumor sites, while the natural macrophages showed a low\nexpression of MHC-II [47].\n\nMore importantly, CAR-macrophages manifest an M1 phenotype due to the\nadenovirus-based transduction process [47]. This enables them to educate the\nTME through the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and costimulatory\nmolecules, amplifying the antitumor actions of both endogenous macrophages and\nother immune cells. Research indicates that CAR-macrophages can induce a\nphenotypic shift in M2 macrophages via interferon signaling, iNOS signaling,\nand the Th1 pathway [47, 51]. In addition, CAR-macrophages express\nsignificantly higher levels of CD80/CD86 than natural macrophages, thus\nbolstering not only the activity but also the infiltration and persistence of\nantitumor T cell response [47].\n\nFinally, CAR-macrophages are capable of revolutionarily targeting the ECM of\nthe tumor site through the release of MMPs. It is well established that TAMs,\nexhibiting M2 phenotypes, are prompted by certain cancer cells to construct a\ndense ECM around the tumor [52\u201354]. As highlighted above, CAR-macrophages\nexhibit M1 phenotypes, which prevent the formation of dense ECM at the tumor\nsite. Furthermore, CD147+ CAR-macrophage upregulates the secretion of MMPs\nduring antigen recognition, thereby degrading the ECM of the tumor [49]. This\nnovel mechanism provides a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy: tumor\nECM density reduction promotes infiltration of other immune cells, such as\ndendritic cells, T cells, and natural killer cells.\n\nIn conclusion, the primary advantage of CAR-macrophage therapy over CAR-T for\nthe treatment of solid tumors lies in the diverse antitumor mechanisms,\nincluding the extensive interactions with other immune cells (by secreting\nvarious proinflammatory cytokines or acting as APC), the ability to potently\nreactivate TME, the capability to promote the persistence of T cell\ninfiltration, and, finally, a novel strategy to target the tumor ECM.

Therefore, dysregulation of this pathway is associated with the\nonset and progression of liver diseases including cancer [201].Fig. 3\n\nWnt-\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. When Wnt signaling is inactive (Wnt OFF),\n\u03b2-catenin within the cytoplasm undergoes phosphorylation by a degradation\ncomplex, which subsequently leads to its breakdown via the proteasome.\nConversely, in the presence of Wnt ligands (Wnt ON), the interaction between\nthe FZD and LRP5/6 receptors is initiated, followed by the phosphorylation of\nLRP6. This event attracts GSK-3\u03b2, CK1\u03b3, and DVL, disrupting the Axin-led\nphosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin. Consequently, \u03b2-catenin accumulates in the\ncytoplasm and then relocates to the nucleus, where it regulates the\ntranscription of specific genes. By figdraw\n\nOne hallmark of liver cancer is the activation of the Wnt-\u03b2-catenin signaling\npathway through somatic genetic and nongenetic events [202]. Lee et al.\nreported that CTNNB1 and AXIN1 mutations have a prevalence of 30% and 11%,\nrespectively, making them the most frequently observed somatic genetic event\n[203]. CTNNB1, which encodes \u03b2-catenin, is one of the most mutated genes in\nthe Wnt-\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway [203, 204]. Gain-of-function mutations in\nCTNNB1 in HCC inhibit \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation and subsequent breakdown,\nleading to the activation of the Wnt-\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, which then\nenhances cellular growth, and movement [201, 205]. Similarly, a loss-of-\nfunction mutation in AXIN1 disrupts Axin in the \u03b2-catenin degradation complex,\ncausing dysregulation of the Wnt-\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, thereby\ndisrupting cellular homeostasis [187]. Additionally, mutations in CTNNB1 and\nAXIN1 have similar pro-tumor effects on CCA, inducing cell proliferation and\ninhibiting apoptosis [206, 207].\n\nGrowing evidence suggests that nongenetic events contribute to the development\nof liver cancer. The excessive binding of Wnt ligands to receptors is of great\nsignificance in the development of HCC. A previous study revealed that SFRP1\npromoter methylation, which encodes a Wnt signaling antagonist, is present in\n75% of hepatoma cell lines and 48.2% of primary HCCs. This methylation results\nin the downregulation of SFRP1 expression and promotes Wnt ligand-receptor\ninteraction [208]. In addition, HCC tumor cells and inflammation-activated\nmacrophages overexpress Wnt ligands, activating the Wnt-\u03b2-catenin pathway\n[209, 210]. A similar phenomenon was observed in the CCA.

A total of 145\nparticipants are required to detect a change of 75 minutes of moderate-\nintensity PA per week between before and after the 3-month intervention, with\nan output of 90% and a 5% risk (2-sided). This calculation is based on a\nmoderate intensity PA variation of 75 min/week according to the study of Lynch\net al [57], an average moderate-intensity PA of 50.6 (SD 48.2) min/week in a\nsubset of physically inactive cancer survivors from the DEFACTO1 study (not\nyet published), and a common SD of 140, considering the SD of moderate PA\naverages observed before and after the intervention in Lynch et al [57]\u2019s\nstudy.\n\nRecruitment\n\nInformation is disseminated among League Against Cancer committees, with calls\nfor participation in the health education program sent through email.

Thus, the first discovery of RNA in plasma\nand serum was enigmatic (Ref. 6). In 1978, Stroun et al. revealed that a\nportion of circulating RNA was protected from RNase activity via extracellular\nvesicle (EV) encapsulation (Ref. 16), demonstrating one of the key mechanisms\nby which cfRNA evades RNase digestion. The majority of exogenous, cell-free\nmRNAs were found to be digested in plasma/serum with an incubation time of\njust 15 s, bolstering the notion that free form mRNA is unlikely to exist in\nplasma/serum (Ref. 17). In contrast, endogenous RNA, those protected by EVs,\nwere established as highly stable and minimally affected by freeze\u2013thaw cycles\neven in delay of plasma processing for up to 24 h (Ref. 17). Subsequent\nstudies showed that EVs are highly stable when stored at \u221280 \u00b0C (Ref. 18) and\ncan withstand up to 3 months of prolonged heating at 37 \u00b0C (Ref. 19), further\nupholding EV-mediated mRNA stability.\n\nAccumulating evidence indicates a disruption of cellular homeostasis that\nextracellular cell-to-cell communication plays a major role in disease\naetiology (Ref. 20). Cells release a large amount of molecular materials that\ncontribute to signals of homeostasis as well as direct or indirect\nintercellular signalling, and although EVs were initially considered to be\ncellular waste disposal mechanisms with little biological importance, they now\nare recognized as a key constituent in cell-to-cell communication mechanisms.\nThis cell-to-cell communication also extends to extracellular particles (EPs),\na more recently defined, broad class of extracellular RNA (exRNA) carriers.\nDefined together, extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) are excreted\nnanoparticles, released by almost every prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell,\nharbouring DNAs, mRNAs, ncRNAs, proteins, lipids, organelles and metabolites\n(Ref. 21). Most cell secreted vesicles and particles appear to enclose mRNAs,\nand importantly, EVPs can induce phenotypic perturbations on recipient cells.\nDelivery of genetic material via EVPs can be achieved through multiple\nmechanisms including receptor\u2013ligand interactions, direct fusion of membranes\nand endocytic internalization (Ref. 22), and once EVs are internalized,\nhorizontal genetic transfer takes place through various mechanisms such as\ncytoplasm targeting via endosomal fusion. In their review, Gruner and McManus\nemphasized the significance of intercellular communication involving\nextracellular RNAs (Ref. 23). Additionally, they underscored the necessity for\nstandardizing extracellular RNA extraction protocols to improve comparability\nacross studies.\n\nOne of the most interesting biological hypotheses involving EVP genetic\ntransfer is the promotion of distant cancer metastasis through premetastatic\nniche formation (Ref. 24).

As\na nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, Src has been the subject of numerous\nstudies over three decades, in part, because of its association with malignant\ntransformation and oncogenesis [43]. SAR has been extensively studied and used\nfor cancer treatment; however, there have been no studies regarding its\napplication in the field of iPSC/ESC differentiation. In the present study, we\nfound for the first time that the Src inhibitor SAR exerts off-target effects\nto deactivate FAK under low concentration conditions, thereby promoting\nendodermal differentiation.\n\nNumerous studies have highlighted the pivotal role of FAK in early\ndevelopmental processes. For example, Afrikanova et al. demonstrated that the\nselective inhibition of FAK activation induces early endocrine commitment, as\nevidenced by an upregulation in the expression of key transcription factors,\nsuch as NGN3, NEUROD1, and NKX2.2 [44]. A parallel investigation by Liu et al.\ndemonstrated that 3D culture conditions play an important role in promoting\nendocrine commitment, which is consistent with some of our results. They\ndemonstrated that this effect is mediated by the limitation of FAK-dependent\nactivation of the SMAD2/3 pathway. Moreover, the functional maturation of\ninsulin-producing cells was enhanced in 3D culture, a phenomenon attributed to\nthe upregulation of Connexin 36 expression [45]. Previous studies provide\ncompelling evidence supporting the notion that 3D culture hampers the\nactivation of FAK, ultimately fostering commitment to the endocrine lineage\n[45]. These studies support the main findings of our study. Nonetheless, we\ndid not explore the impact of SAR on intercellular communication in the\npresent study, which represents an intriguing avenue for future studies. While\ncurrent research on stem cell differentiation into organoids has primarily\nfocused on phenotypic analyses, mechanistic studies remain less comprehensive.\nAcknowledging this gap, we advocate a paradigm shift toward identifying the\nunderlying mechanisms through which various small molecule drugs promote\ndifferentiation. Current studies have examined the downstream effects of FAK\nduring the differentiation process. Wrighton et al. revealed that\nextracellular signals modulate the autophosphorylation level at the\nintracellular FAK 397 site through integrin signaling, thereby regulating the\nactivation of the AKT pathway to balance the differentiation and self-renewal\nof embryonic stem cells [46]. Human FAK contains several tyrosine residues\nthat can be phosphorylated, including Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr576, Tyr577, and\nTyr925 [47]. Among these, Tyr397 is the most crucial phosphorylation site, the\nactivation of which can initiate downstream signaling. Tyr576 and Tyr577 are\nlocated within the kinase domain of FAK and serve as enhancers for the kinase\nactivity of FAK [48]. Phosphorylation of Y576/Y577 signifies full catalytical\nactivity of FAK [49]. Phosphorylated Y925 is a docking site for the adaptor\nprotein Grb2 [50], which links FAK signaling to the Ras/MAPK signaling\npathway. However, phosphorylated Y925 seems to have no direct relationship\nwith the tyrosine kinase activity of FAK. In summary, we believe that the\nphosphorylation status of the FAK Y397 site best represents the activation or\ninhibition of FAK kinase activity, while Y576/577 can serve as a supportive\nreference, and Y925 is not\n\n", "question": "What is the role of FAK in early developmental processes?", "answer": "FAK plays a pivotal role in early developmental processes, and its inhibition can induce early endocrine commitment."}

RAS is activated by interacting with GTP in\nthe presence of guanine exchange factors (GEFs). RAS is transformed to its\ninactive state through hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, facilitated by GAPs. RAS\nproteins stimulate several biological activities, such as cell proliferation,\nthrough multiple downstream signaling pathways. Each member of the RAS family\nhas distinct activity on various cell types through gene regulation.

Various types of tumors exhibit distinct control of KRAS. 234\n\nStimulation of a receptor\u2010linked tyrosine kinase, like the epidermal growth\nfactor receptor, can trigger the activation of RAS in a signaling cascade\nlocated upstream. Phosphorylation cascade can be triggered by the\nhomodimerization of epidermal growth factor receptors when they bind to\nexternal growth factors. Subsequently, GEFs and growth factor receptor\u2010bound 2\nadaptor protein activate RAS by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP,\nresulting in the creation of KRAS\u2010GTP.

A complex interplay between\nkinases and phosphatases contributes to signaling events and cellular\nhomeostasis (1). Abnormal activation of kinases and inactivation of\nphosphatases can lead to pathological hyperphosphorylation, a key factor in\nthe development of numerous diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative\ndisorders (2, 3). Much attention has been given to kinase inhibitors for the\ntreatment of these diseases. Phosphatases, on the other hand, have been much\nless studied as drug targets (4\u20139) mainly due to the lack of druggable pockets\nnear their active sites (10, 11).\n\nOne major class of phosphatases playing a central role in maintaining cellular\nhomeostasis is the family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases 2A (PP2A)\n(12\u201314). PP2A is frequently dysregulated in human diseases, making it an\nattractive target for therapeutic interventions (15). It is a heterotrimer,\ncomposed of a scaffold (A) subunit, known as PR65, a catalytic (C) subunit,\nand one of many regulatory (B) subunits. The A and C subunits form the core of\nPP2A.The specificity of PP2A is controlled by the choice of the regulatory\nsubunit that binds the AC core, with over 40 different B subunits each\ndetermining the specific substrate bound to PP2A (3). The diverse array of B\nsubunits allows PP2A to exert control over a majority of cellular signaling\npathways.\n\nPR65 serves as a structural scaffold that provides a platform for the assembly\nof the heterotrimer (16). Among the three PP2A subunits, PR65 experiences the\nhighest frequency of mutations, which have been implicated in altering PP2A\nactivity (17\u201319). Understanding the impact of PR65 point mutations on PP2A\nstructure and function is essential to unraveling the mechanisms underlying\nvarious diseases and developing targeted therapeutic strategies (20). PR65 is\na tandem repeat (TR) protein consisting of 15 HEAT repeats, each comprising\n~40-residue antiparallel helices. These repeats stack in a one-dimensional\nfashion, forming an elongated, horseshoe-like superhelical structure composed\nof outer and inner helices layers. Many TR proteins act as hubs in\nmultiprotein complexes, whereby their conformational fluctuations facilitate\nthe function of the assembly (21\u201323).

Consistent with the association between PRMT1/5 and the\nDDR signature (Figure 3), significant positive correlations between PRMT1/5\nand ERCC1 mRNA expression levels were observed in primary tumor specimens from\nthe TCGA cohort (Figure 5E). These results suggest that elevated PRMT\nexpression in cancer may serve as a mechanism to epigenetically maintain ERCC1\nexpression, which is critical to the survival of cancer cells that are\nsubjected to high levels of endogenous DNA damage and increased replication-\nrelated stress. Using western blots, we demonstrated that PRMTi treatments\nrepressed ERCC1 expression at the protein level in a dose-dependent manner\n(Figure 5F). As expected, under these treatment conditions, GSK3368715 and\nGSK3235025 reduced global aDMA and sDMA levels, respectively. Notably, in\nconsistence with previous reports73, 99, the GSK3368715 treatment also\nincreased global sDMA levels (Figure S4), suggesting that PRMT1 and PRMT5\nshare a substrate (i.e., MMA), and/or their functions may be compensatory in\ncertain cellular contexts73, 99. These observations were also validated by\ngenetically knocking out PRMT1 and PRMT5 independently using CRISPR/Cas9\n(Figure 5G and Figure S4B). To determine whether the repression of ERCC1 by\nPRMTis was mediated by an epigenetic (transcriptional) mechanism, we cloned\nthe ERCC1 promoter region (\u22121,500 to +120) and inserted it into a reporter\nvector (pGL3-basic). Both the chemical PRMTi treatment and genetic knockout of\nPRMT1/5 significantly reduced ERCC1 promoter activities in cells (Figure 5H).\nNext, we determined whether the PRMTi treatment was able to reduce the ERCC1\nfunction. ERCC1 and XPF form a structure-specific nuclease that is required\nfor the removal of ultraviolet (UV) radiation-generated cyclobutane pyrimidine\ndimers (CPDs). Thus, measuring the rate of UV-induced CPD removal serves as a\nsemi-quantitative assay to monitor ERCC1 activity100, 101 (Figure 5I). The\nOVCAR8 cells were pretreated with GSK3368715 (2.5 \u03bcM) and GSK3235025 (5 \u03bcM)\nindependently for 48 h, then CPDs were induced by exposure to UV radiation (15\nJ/m2, Figure 5I). Using a specific CPD antibody (Kamiya Biomedical Company,\nMC-062)100, 101, immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that PRMTi treatments\nsignificantly decreased the CPD removal rates compared with controls after UV\nexposure (Figure 5J). This observation was validated by genetically knocking\nout PRMT1 or PRMT5 using CRISPR/Cas9 (Figure 5K). Additionally, a DNA-blotting\nassay confirmed the immunofluorescent staining results (Figure 5L, M). To\nfurther demonstrate the functional involvement of ERCC1 in the synergistic\nactions between PRMTis and PARPi, we knocked out ERCC1 in cancer cell lines\nusing CRISPR/Cas9 (Figure 5N). As expected, the ERCC1-XPF activity was\nsignificantly reduced (Figure S5). Colony formation assays demonstrated that\nERCC1 knockout cancer cell lines were sensitized to PARPi treatments (Figure\n5O). Finally, the forced ERCC1 expression by lentiviral infection partially\nreduced the synergistic actions between PRMTis and PARPi in these cell lines\n(<xref ref-type=\"fig\"\n\n", "question": "What is the role of PRMT1 and PRMT5 in cancer cells?", "answer": "PRMT1 and PRMT5 epigenetically maintain ERCC1 expression, which is critical for the survival of cancer cells."}

Interestingly, AlphaFold\ngenerated accurate models of both N17.1.2 complexes, but accuracy depended on\nAlphaFold implementation and the number of models produced, whereas it did not\ngenerate high scoring models for the other complexes modeled.

{"id": "PMC11144156-23", "context": "that PRL stimulated the nuclear translocation of NRF2 and the mRNA levels of\nNrf2 and of the NRF2 target gene Hmox1. Further, PRL upregulation of these\ngenes was abrogated by the inhibition of STAT3 signaling. Noticeably, the peak\nof Nrf2 mRNA expression occurred eight hours after exposure to PRL, much\nearlier than the significant increase of Sod1 and Gpx1 expression observed 24\nh after exposure to PRL. Subsequently, as previously reported [47], NRF2 may\ndirectly activate its own transcription, providing a positive feedback\nmechanism to amplify NRF2 effects. On the other hand, it has been recently\nshown an alternative mechanism for the functional interplay of STAT3 and NRF2\nbased on the binding of SOCS3 to KEAP1 [77]. Activated STAT3 induces the\nexpression of certain SOCS genes, including Socs3 that binds to phosphorylated\nJAK and its receptor to negatively regulate the JAK\u2013STAT signaling pathway\n[78]. Meng et al. showed that SOCS3, derived from STAT3 activation, can\ndirectly bind to KEAP1 to prevent the degradation of NRF2, resulting in the\nactivation of an NRF2-dependent transcriptional program in non-small cell lung\ncancer cells. This mechanism could be potentially involved in the interplay of\nSTAT3 and NRF2 in response to PRL in astrocytes, considering that\nSTAT3-dependent expression of SOCS3 has been observed in primary astrocytes\n[79, 80] and in response to PRL [81]. Thus, further investigation is needed.\n\nAlthough STAT3 is known to upregulate Sod2 expression in cortical and\nhippocampal neurons by binding to its promoter [82, 83], our findings suggest\nthis pathway is not functional in astrocytes in response to PRL. The precise\nmechanism by which PRL upregulates Sod2 expression in astrocytes remains to be\nelucidated. We found some evidence suggesting a potential role for the\ntranscription factor NF-\u03baB. The Sod2 promoter contains a functional NF-\u03baB\nbinding site, and activation of NF-\u03baB has been shown to increase Sod2\nexpression in neurons and astrocytes [84, 85]. Notably, PRL activation of NF-\n\u03baB has been observed in primary hippocampal neurons and mammary epithelial\ncells [86, 87]. Therefore, PRL-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB could be a key\nfactor involved in the upregulation of Sod2 expression in astrocytes. Further\ninvestigation is necessary to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nOpen questions remain regarding the complete effects of PRL on astrocytes. Our\ndata demonstrate that the lack of PRL receptor increased carbonyl group\ncontent under basal conditions. The precise reason for this accumulation\nremains unclear. Since ROS are constantly generated throughout cellular life\nand our data indicate that basal ROS production is not affected by the lack of\nPRL receptor, the accumulation of oxidized proteins could be due to two\npotential mechanisms: lower antioxidant capacity in the absence of PRL\nsignaling, which is normally able to prevent protein oxidation, or decreased\ndegradation of oxidized proteins, or a combination of both [88]. Further\ninvestigation is needed to elucidate the exact cause of this accumulation.\n\nIn conclusion, our study unveils the protective role of PRL against the\noxidative stress-induced damage of astrocytes.
