Examples: Context: 1 Introduction Breast cancer (BRCA) is one of the most common malignant tumors in women worldwide and a major cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally (Sung et al., 2021). The number of new BRCA cases is on the rise annually across the world, particularly in developing countries. Studies have shown that accounts for approximately 60%\u201390% of BRCA-related deaths are attributed to metastasis of tumor (Dillekas et al., 2019; Krishnan et al., 2021). Thus, early detection is critical for BLCA treatment and prognosis. Mammography and ultrasound have been utilized for standardizing breast lesion risk assessment, among which mammography screening reduced breast cancer mortality by \u223c20% (Screening, 2012; Christiansen et al., 2022). However, they are susceptible to high false positive rates, resulting in unnecessary biopsies. Particularly in case of high-density breast tissue, the detection sensitivity is compromised. Therefore, there is a need for new precise detection methods to compensate for the deficiency in breast lesion detection. The occurrence and progression of tumors are accompanied by a series of reconstruction processes of the genome and epigenome (Chakravarthi et al., 2016; Ushijima et al., 2021). Among them, DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression and chromatin structure in a complex way affecting gene expression. Studies have confirmed that abnormal methylation patterns play an important role in the occurrence and progression of breast cancer and other malignant tumors (Kulis and Esteller, 2010; Ma et al., 2023). Since the DNA methylation modification process precedes protein translation, abnormal methylation patterns can be detected in the early stages of cancer development, and thus DNA methylation markers may have greater value in early diagnosis of breast cancer compared to detecting cancer-related protein expression levels. Currently, the most widely used diagnostic application related to methylation modification is the Sept9 methylation detection for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer based on cell-free DNA (cf- DNA) in peripheral blood (Galanopoulos et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2018), but its accuracy for early diagnosis is less than 80%. For detecting breast cancer, CA153 antigen detection is used as a breast cancer diagnostic method (Stefan- van Staden and van Staden, 2013; Tang et al., 2016). The antigen detected by this assay kit is significantly elevated in the serum of late-stage breast cancer patients. Its effectiveness for early breast cancer diagnosis is also not ideal. Therefore, it is more commonly applied for preoperative detection and monitoring disease progression after surgery. Developing new methods for early breast cancer diagnosis, especially DNA methylation biomarkers, thus has great significance for the implementation of precision medicine for breast cancer. In healthy individuals, 70%\u201380% of CpG sequences are in a methylated state, which is very important for maintaining body functions (Sulewska et al., 2007). In tumor cells, specific genes experience high methylation of CpG islands, termed CpG island methylator phenotype (CpG island methylator phenotype, CIMP). Different tumors have different detection sites for CIMP, but the biological mechanisms and pathogenesis of most CIMPs have not been clearly studied. Therefore, there are no unified identification methods and Question: What cancer antigen is used for detection of breast cancer? Answer: CA 15-3. It is usually significantly elevated in the serum of late-stage breast cancer patients. Context: study, reconstruction timing did not show a significant association with breast complications, and the ESTRO-ACROP target volume delineation method did not affect complications in either two-stage delayed reconstruction or immediate reconstruction subgroups. For implant placement, the differences in breast complications between prepectoral and subpectoral approaches are controversial yet (29\u201331). We do find it reassuring that the rates of breast complications observed in our cohort were generally comparable to those reported in previous studies. Our findings suggest that introducing the new ESTRO-ACROP guideline is feasible for patients who underwent subpectoral reconstruction in terms of breast complications. Based on well-known randomized trials that established hypofractionated regimen as an effective alternative for adjuvant RT after breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy (32\u201335), a multi-institutional study by the Korean Radiation Oncology Group evaluated the feasibility of hypofractionated RT after breast reconstruction. It revealed that hypofractionated PMRT can improve breast reconstruction outcomes (36). Other recent retrospective studies also suggested that a hypofractionated regimen was comparable with a conventional fractionation in terms of breast-related complications, regardless of breast reconstruction type (14) and surgical extent (37). The major difference between the conventional and the 2019 ESTRO-ACROP guidelines is in the definition of the CTV of the chest wall. Whereas prior contouring guidelines generally included the whole implant, the new ESTRO- ACROP guidelines removed it from the CTV in selected patients (16, 18). Of note, in patients with subpectoral implant breast reconstruction, where implants were inserted in the pocket between the pectoral major and minor, a convex strip of subcutaneous and remnant breast tissue between the anterior and skin of the pectoral major was covered. The new ESTRO-ACROP guideline has dosimetric benefits to adjacent normal organs when using modern volume-based planning techniques. Chang et al. compared dosimetric characteristics of patients with left-sided breast cancer between two guidelines in VMAT planning. It revealed that the new target volume delineation method significantly reduced exposure to the heart, left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), and ipsilateral lung, maintaining target coverage, delivery accuracy, and dose heterogeneity compared with conventional delineation (17). Similarly, Milligan et al. also evaluated the changes in normal organ sparing and target coverage with VMAT and pencil-beam scan planning, finding that the ESTRO target has dosimetric advantages to cardiopulmonary organs (18). Previous studies have shown that increasing radiation doses to the heart, left ventricle, and LAD are directly associated with long-term rates of high-grade coronary artery stenosis and acute coronary events (38\u201340). Also, radiation pneumonitis and radiation fibrosis are well-known toxicities caused by RT in patients with breast cancer, which have a correlation with increasing radiation dose to the lung (41, 42). It is noteworthy that the new guideline could minimize RT-induced adverse events, as most patients with breast cancer are expected to have long-term survival. There might be a concern about increasing recurrences at deep chest wall structures, which Question: What are the advantages of the new ESTRO-ACROP guideline?

{"context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021). Alternol was isolated from the fermentation of a mutant fungus obtained from Taxus brevifolia bark (Liu et al., 2020).

{"context": "Introduction\n\nThere is widespread confusion about hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This\nconfusion has occurred primarily because of misinterpretation of results from\nthe Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study conducted in the 1991-early 2000\ntimeframe. The WHI study was suspended because of adverse side effects on the\nstudy participants. Many commentators declared that the concept of HRT was\n\u201cdead\u201d.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAnalysis of the results from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study (1)\nrevealed that participants who took Prempro, a combination of Premarin\n(conjugated equine estrogen) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) had a\nhigher incidence of side effects, including breast cancer and heart attacks,\nthan control group participants who were assigned a placebo. On the other\nhand, hysterectomized participants who took only Premarin had a lower\nincidence of side effects than control group participants who were assigned a\nplacebo. It can therefore be concluded that MPA is the culprit in increasing\nthe likelihood of side effects of HRT, not the estrogen. This article\nconcluded that \u201cOur analysis suggests that failure to differentiate among\npopulations of women and preparations of HT has cost thousands of lives\u201d.\n\nThe USFDA generalized the WHI results to assume that any HRT products were\ndangerous to women's health. The USFDA requires a \u201cblack box\u201d warning on all\nUSFDA-approved HRT products that includes the statement: \u201cA study of women\ntaking an estrogen with a progestin showed a raised risk of heart attack,\nstroke, blood clot, breast cancer, and dementia\u201d.\n\nBecause MPA is a harmful synthetic progestin does not mean that all synthetic\nprogestins are harmful. Another study investigated the effect of HRT\ncontaining the synthetic progestin norethisterone acetate on recently\npostmenopausal women in Denmark (2). The conclusion of the study was \u201cOur\nfindings suggest that initiation of hormone replacement therapy in women early\nafter menopause significantly reduces the risk of the combined endpoint of\nmortality, myocardial infarction, or heart failure. Importantly, early\ninitiation and prolonged hormone replacement therapy did not result in an\nincreased risk of breast cancer or stroke\u201d.\n\nIt seems clear from these two studies that the HRT therapies that do not\ninclude MPA result in improvement in women's cardiovascular health.\nUnfortunately, the USFDA prohibits statements that support the use of any HRT\nformulations to improve cardiovascular health, because they assume that the\nrisks are high, based on the results of the WHI study that included the use of\nMPA.\n\nMany HRT therapies have been approved by the USFDA that consist of\nbioidentical HRT products. The term \u201cbioidentical\u201d means the hormones in the\nproduct are chemically identical to those that the body produces. Estradiol is\na bioidentical estrogen that is available in pills, patches, sprays, creams,\ngels, and vaginal tablets. Transdermal estradiol applications seem to be more\ndesirable than estrogen pills because the estradiol does not go through the\nliver. If the uterus is intact, progestogens are added to the estrogen therapy\nto reduce the risk of cancer of the uterus. Bioidentical progestogen products\ninclude micronized progesterone, such as Prometrium. Recently, the USFDA has\napproved Bijuva, a combination pill that includes both bioidentical estradiol\nand bioidentical progesterone.\n\nCampagnoli et al. (3) reviewed the influence of progestins and progesterone on\nthe risk of breast cancer (BC) to provide suggestions for the prescription of\nHRT in climacteric women.

Communities were\nthen assigned representative names based on the enriched cell types within\nthem (Supplementary Fig. S3F). The community identities were mapped onto\nsegmented cells and visualized using Cytomapper (Supplementary Fig. S3G; ref.\n88), which were then validated by pathologist assessment of serial H&E-stained\ntissue sections.\n\nTo check that the communities we detected in the TME were robust, we performed\na series of tests to validate our results. To find the optimal k number of\ncommunities, we varied the number of communities and measured the stability of\nconstituent cell types within them.

{"context": "Introduction\n\nIn terms of malignancies in women, breast cancer (BC) is the most common and\none of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide1. The mortality of BC\npatients has been significantly reduced by radical surgery, radiotherapy,\nchemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy within the past decade,\nbut many patients still experience recurrence or metastasis, eventually\nleading to death2. The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5. Mitochondria are the key organelles involved in\nmetabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, and maintaining mitochondrial\nintegrity is the absolute basis of oxidative phosphorylation6. In addition,\nprevious studies have also indicated that the number, structure, and function\nof mitochondria often change in malignant tumor cells to meet the needs of\nrapid growth in acidic and anoxic environments7.\n\nAs a key regulatory subunit of mitochondrial integrity, mitochondrial inner\nmembrane protein (IMMT), also known as Mic-60 or Mitofilin8, is not only an\nimportant part of the mitochondrial contact sites and cristae organization\nsystem (MICOS) complex, but it also interacts with members of the SAM (The\nSorting and Assembly Machinery) complex to form the mitochondrial membrane\nspace bridging complex9. Recent studies have linked IMMT to the onset of\nvarious diseases, including cardiomyopathy10, degenerative encephalopathy11\nand kidney injury12. However, research on the significance of IMMT in cancers\nis rare, and the only literature proposed that IMMT expression might be\nrelated to cancer prognosis13,14. To date, few reports have been published on\nthe relationship between IMMT and the development and progression of BC, and\nthe functions of IMMT in BC remains largely undefined.\n\nThe purpose of this investigation was to delve into the potential functions\nand underlying biological processes of IMMT in the development and progression\nof BC. To achieve this objective, bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry\n(IHC) were utilized to determine the prognostic significance of IMMT and its\ncorrelation with clinicopathological parameters in BC patients.

{"context": "subsequent internalization, leading to lysosomal degradation and attenuation of CAR T cell function and persistence (36). To address this issue, a novel approach involving the development of a modified CAR, termed rCAR, was devised. This modified CAR features mutations in cytoplasmic lysine residues to reduce susceptibility to ubiquitination-induced downregulation. Notably, rCAR demonstrates the ability to resurface on the cell membrane following internalization, thereby maintaining functionality within intracellular compartments. In preclinical mouse tumor models, rCAR T cells exhibit elevated surface CAR expression, enhanced cytotoxicity, prolonged survival, and superior anti-tumor effects compared to conventional CAR T cells (36). In summary, lysosome-targeted cancer immunotherapy offers a multifaceted approach to disrupt tumor-immune interactions within the TME, potentially enhancing therapeutic outcomes. However, significant challenges including selective drug delivery, safety concerns, resistance mechanisms, and the need for elucidation of underlying mechanisms warrant further investigation. This concise summary underscores the central role of the ES in both innate and adaptive immunity and in immunotherapy. Thus, proper function of endolysosomal compartments is crucial for proper regulation of immune response and surveillance. This connection is important to highlight, as impaired immune response and mechanisms that aid cancer cells to escape immune surveillance are prerequisites of cancer. 1.2Impaired ion channel function in cancer cells Impairment and manipulation of endolysosomal function have been shown to be one major mechanism of cells to sustain multiple cancer hallmarks (37). Therefore, one can say that proper lysosomal function is crucial for proper cell function. Lysosomal functionality is maintained by preserving low lysosomal pH and therefore securing enzymatic function through two main protein groups: the more than 60 hydrolytic enzymes located inside the lysosomes and lysosomal membrane proteins (2, 38, 39). The lysosomal membrane proteins and ion channels not only secure acidification of the lysosomal lumen, but also regulate protein imports from the cytosol, fusion with other organelles and transport of degradation products to the cytoplasm (40). The most prominent membrane proteins are the lysosome-associated membrane glycoproteins (LAMPs) and the vacuolar-type H+ ATPase (V-ATPase), an ATP-dependent proton pump. Past research has shown that V-ATPase does not only maintain the required low lysosomal pH (41), but it has become evident that it plays a significant role in cancer (42\u201345). Primarily, V-ATPase has been found to be overexpressed in cancer, which promotes ECM (extracellular matrix) degradation and consequently cancer cell invasion and migration (46). Additionally, inhibition of V-ATPase has been shown to reduce cancer cell proliferation, induce apoptosis and promote mitochondrial fission (43, 47). The unravelling of the role of V-ATPase and hence lysosomal ion homeostasis in cancer progression was followed by multiple clinical trials. However, V-ATPase inhibitors largely failed in clinical trials (48), which shifted the limelight to further lysosomal ion regulators, i.e. ion channels and their potential role in maintaining cancer hallmarks.

{"context": "1Introduction\n\nCompared to general anesthesia and systemic analgesia, regional nerve block\ntechniques provide important strengths, such as decreased side effects and\naccelerated recovery from anesthesia (1). Postoperative pain is an adverse\noutcome resulting in distress to the patient and an increase in the\nconsumption of opioids for rescue analgesia. Due to concern about common and\nsevere side effects of opioids, including sedation, nausea and vomiting,\ndizziness, constipation, and respiratory depression, anesthesiologists are\nalways looking for preferable approaches to improve postoperative pain,\nprolong analgesia, and reduce the administration of opioids. Erector spinae\nplane block (ESPB), a new regional nerve block technique, is a paraspinal\ninterfacial plane block targeting the ventral and dorsal branches of the\nspinal nerve under ultrasonic guidance (2, 3). This local blocking method has\nbeen proven effective for alleviating postoperative pain, decreasing\npostoperative opioid consumption, reducing postoperative stays in the\nhospital, and maintaining hemodynamic stability, with rarely corresponding\ncomplications (4\u20138). However, even with the administration of long-acting LAs,\nthe analgesic effect of ESPB block with LAs alone lasts only 6 to 8 h (9).\n\nDexmedetomidine is a selective \u03b12 agonist that has been proven safe and\neffective when added to LAs to prolong the analgesic effects of the regional\nnerve block and is accompanied by sedation, anti-anxiety, hypnosis, and\ninhibition of perioperative sympathetic excitation (10\u201312). It can prolong the\nduration of a single-shot block by inhibiting nerve conduction (13). Previous\nstudies have demonstrated that adding dexmedetomidine to the brachial plexus\nblocks could accelerate block onset, prolong the duration of sensory block,\nimprove the analgesic effect, and reduce morphine consumption (14). At\npresent, the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in ESPB is not clear. Besides, its\npotential adverse reactions in regional nerve block, such as hypotension and\nbradycardia, limit its use (15). In addition, the efficacy and the side-\nadverse reactions of dexmedetomidine may also be dose-dependent (16).\n\nAlthough previous meta-analyses have discussed the adjuvant pharmacological\neffects of dexmedetomidine in ESPB, they have not summarized any important\nbenefits quantitatively in the clinic (17). Hence, our study aimed to examine\nthe potential of dexmedetomidine at varying concentrations to enhance pain\nmanagement and mitigate side effects in patients undergoing elective surgery\nwith ESPB for perioperative analgesia.\n\n2Materials and methods\n\nOur study followed the PRISMA (18) recommendations in preparing this\nmanuscript.

Classified by their maturation levels, \u03b3\u03b4T cells categorize into four\nfunctionally distinct subpopulations: na\u00efve \u03b3\u03b4T cells, central memory \u03b3\u03b4T\ncells, effector memory \u03b3\u03b4T cells, and terminally differentiated effector\nmemory \u03b3\u03b4T cells (69). The latter two subpopulations express CD16, a surface\nreceptor that efficiently facilitates tumor cell killing, even in the absence\nof antibody engagement (68, 70). V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells, isolated from PBMCs of\nhealthy donors, undergo activation, leading to the expression of CD16, a\nphenomenon not observed in their unstimulated counterparts (71). Furthermore,\nwhen TCR-activated V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells are cross-linked to plastic wells with anti-\nCD16 monoclonal antibodies, substantial TNF-\u03b1 production occurs, a response\nmitigated by the addition of soluble anti-CD16 monoclonal antibodies (71).\n\nThe cytotoxic activity of \u03b3\u03b4T cells is also ascribed to the expression of\nTRAIL and FasL, which bind to corresponding receptors on tumor cells (72, 73)\n( Figure 1 ). TRAIL\u2019s interaction with different receptors produces varied\noutcomes: knockdown of TRAIL-Receptor 4(TRAIL-R4) in Colo357 and MDA-MB-231\ncells significantly reduces sensitivity to \u03b3\u03b4T cell-induced cytotoxicity,\nwhereas TRAIL-R4 knock-in HeLa cells show reinforced cytotoxicity (74).\nFurthermore, serum TRAIL levels hold clinical significance, as evidenced in a\nstudy involving eighteen patients with refractory prostate cancer, where\nhigher serum TRAIL levels at nine months correlated with improved clinical\noutcomes (75).

Since glucose utilization is indicative of glycolysis, a metabolic pathway linked to metastasis, we looked to alternative methods to quantify shifts in cellular metabolism due to alignment effects on a broader scale. This was accomplished using lifetime and intensity approaches to quantify single-cell metabolic states. FLIM measurements of NADH suggested that variations in alignment of the cellular microenvironment resulted in significant differences in cellular metabolic signatures. We found that the average fluorescence lifetime values of NADH in both cell lines were consistent with those in the literature [90, 91, 92]. For both cell lines, we observed a decrease in average NADH lifetime for cells on the aligned condition as quantified by the NADH metabolic index.

{"context": "CAFs are induced by cancer cells through TGF-\u03b2, and they create a mechanical\nbarrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth. Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

Therefore, it is likely that the different effects of multi-node and single-node PAM inhibitors on cellular functions like cell proliferation and migration are linked to different effects on cancer cells\u2019 metabolism. To address this question, we tested the impact of gedatolisib, alpelisib, capivasertib, and everolimus on key metabolic activities.\n\nFirst, we compared the effects of gedatolisib and single-node PAM inhibitors on glucose consumption and lactate production in three BC cells lines with various PIK3CA/PTEN mutational status.

Our findings suggest that introducing the new\nESTRO-ACROP guideline is feasible for patients who underwent subpectoral\nreconstruction in terms of breast complications.\n\nBased on well-known randomized trials that established hypofractionated\nregimen as an effective alternative for adjuvant RT after breast-conserving\nsurgery and mastectomy (32\u201335), a multi-institutional study by the Korean\nRadiation Oncology Group evaluated the feasibility of hypofractionated RT\nafter breast reconstruction.

It is\ncharacterized by a dysfunction of two or more organ systems caused at a\nmolecular level by cellular, humoral, and biochemical mediators, which will\nfinally lead to the formation of tissue-damaging end products [1]. Evidence\nsuggests that MODS is among the most important factors that determine the\nsurvival rate in patients with advanced cancer in ICU settings, and therefore,\ncaution should be taken.\n\nIn patients with an underlying malignancy or early stage of disease, a\nsubclinical syndrome of multiple failure organs can occur\u2014a loss of function\nof vital organs, potentially reversible, compensated by the organism with its\nhomeostasis. In the context of breast cancer, the exploration of subclinical\nmultiple organ failure syndrome is of clinical significance because it can\nlead to understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease progression and\nclinical degradation. Ideally, the subclinical phase of breast cancer requires\na comprehensive examination before the onset of clinical manifestations.\nTherefore, investigating this syndrome in breast cancer patients is imperative\nfor early detection, intervention, and personalized patient management.\nUnveiling this subclinical phenomenon also provides a unique opportunity to\nrefine treatment strategies because mastectomy, especially when performed on\nboth breasts, is a well-known QoL-reducing factor described in the literature.\nThus, our study contributes to improved patient outcomes, prolonged survival,\nand enhanced quality of life. Despite substantial research, data about the\nsubclinical multiple organ failure syndrome are scarce, especially in\noncologic patients. Moreover, this concept is not fully understood by\noncologists because of its similar manifestations with adverse reactions of\nintensive antineoplastic therapies (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy,\ncorticosteroids), oncologic emergencies of sepsis, and disseminated\nintravascular coagulation [1]. Due to this lack of research, neither treatment\nnor intervention has proven efficient in preventing or controlling the\ninadequate response of the body in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [2].\n\nRecent large clinical studies have turned their attention to adjuvant\ntherapies to limit the metastasis process, but their effect on how they\nrestrain the tumor from disseminating is still unclear [3]. Despite these\nresults, the actual treatment aims at molecular targets like HER2/neu [4] and\nCDK4/6 inhibitors [5]. However, these key components in molecular aberrations\nin cancerous cells have yet to be proven as a significant factor in the\nprocess of dissemination [6]. Thus, high-quality clinical studies made the\nactual guidelines for breast cancer therapy and the probability of metastasis\nconditioned by molecular markers and predictive statistical models [7].\n\nAs much as prolonging survival, quality of life (QoL) in oncologic patients\nshould not only be carefully monitored from the beginning of the diagnosis but\nalso improved during the disease and treatment [8,9,10].

It means that symptom\nmanagement could improve patients' depression 26 conversely interventions on\nanxiety and depression could reduce symptom burden among cancer patients. 27\n\nUnfortunately, there were a huge gap between the need of symptom management\nand received treatment in patients with advanced cancer. Only 25% of patients\nwere undertaking drug therapy for their symptoms, and only 2.6% of the\npatients were taking psychiatric medication. It is consistent with the\nfounding of Driessen et al. that the domain of psychological issues is the\nmost unmet care need in advanced cancer patients. 17 The low use of drug\ntherapy for symptoms reveals the current clinical reality that patients with\nadvanced cancer do not receive sufficient symptoms management, but also not\nget enough attention on their psychological symptoms and not obtain good\nmental health services. International data also demonstrate that only a small\nproportion of cancer patients with psychological symptoms receive appropriate\ntreatment. 28 ,  29 Inadequate treatment of psychological symptoms may be due\nto clinicians' insufficient understanding of harm of anxiety or depression and\ntheir greater emphasis on physical symptoms rather than psychological\nsymptoms. In addition, current study found the symptom burden were associated\nwith disease stage in advanced cancer; therefore, there should be more\nattention on symptoms management in palliative care.\n\nSeveral underlying mechanisms may lead to the fact that anxiety and depression\nwere associated with symptom burden in cancer patients. Anxiety and depression\nmay result in abnormal hyperactivity HPA axis, elevated cortisol levels,\nrelease of inflammatory markers, less healthy lifestyles and behavior, which\nlead to multiple physical symptoms, and even a higher cancer\u2010specific\nmortality risk for variety types of cancer including CRC. 30 Some studies\nsuggest that the increase in the proportion of physical symptoms in patients\nwith depression may be due to somatosensory amplification, which indicates\nthat depression can affect the perception and evaluation of physical symptoms\nthrough their impact on higher cognitive processing patterns. 11 Although\nsomatosensory amplification is a possible cause for increased proportion, the\nphysical symptoms of patients are actually occurring and painful.

Given that copper can also induce cuproptosis under\ncertain conditions [106], it would be intriguing to delve deeper into\nelucidating the interplay between cuproptosis and ferroptosis in the context\nof radiotherapy.\n\nFurthermore, targeting regulators of ferroptosis, such as AIFM2 [270],\nglutathione synthetase (GSS), GPX4, FA complementation group D2 (FANCD2), and\nMAF BZIP transcription factor F (MAFF) can sensitize specific cancers to\nradiotherapy-dependent ferroptosis [271\u2013275]. Additionally, radiotherapy\ninduces radiation colitis in patients, affecting their quality of life.\nHowever, an orally administered Pickering emulsion stabilized with halloysite\nclay nanotubes can inhibit ferroptosis, alleviating radiocolitis in vitro and\nin vivo [276].

Over the past decade, the emergence of immunotherapy, especially\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors, has significantly altered the paradigm of tumor\ntreatment; however, only a minority of patients exhibit responsiveness to\nimmunotherapy. Consequently, addressing this challenge necessitates additional\nstrategies to augment immunotherapy efficacy.\n\nRecent research suggests that enhancing ferroptosis responses could\npotentially amplify the effectiveness of immunotherapy. For instance, anti-\nCD274-mediated immunotherapy triggers CD8+ T cells to release IFNG,\nsubsequently inhibiting SLC7A11 and inducing ferroptosis, thereby enhancing\nimmunotherapy in vivo [267]. ACSL4-dependent tumor ferroptosis, induced by the\ncombination of IFN-gamma and arachidonic acid, also triggers CD8+ T cell-\ndependent antitumor immunity [277].

{"context": "JAK-STAT pathway can both be triggered by and cause inflammation. In the JAK-STAT pathway, STAT1 molecules interact with other STAT proteins and MUC1 to bind to the promoter regions of other ISGs which leads to their increased expression49,50. The protein encoded by IFITM1, which harbored 10 significant CpG sites in our study, inhibits HIV replication partially through interfering with virus-cell membrane fusion, viral particle infectivity, and viral protein synthesis51\u201353. IFIT proteins can develop a functional complex to restrict viral translation and modulate innate immune signaling54. Specifically, IFIT1 molecules bind to an uncapped 5\u2019-ppp on HIV RNA to sequester those RNA while IFIT3 proteins serve to enhance the binding function of IFIT1 molecules54,55. Proteins encoded by genes MX1, OAS2\u20133, IFI27, IRF7 and ISG20 have also been shown to inhibit HIV viral replication by diverse mechanisms56\u201359. On the other hand, proteins PARP9 and IFI44L may contribute to antiviral responses by mitigating STAT1 molecules in the JAK-STAT pathway60,61 while ISG15 functions as a negative regulator of IFN-1 signaling to prevent overt inflammation62. A recent study has shown that cells treated with IFITM1-targeted Small interfering RNA (siRNA) cells had attenuated levels of STAT1 and ISG15, suggesting a mediating effect of IFITM1 protein in IFN-\u03b3 stimulated protein synthesis63. The interferon signaling pathways could be sustaining the persistent inflammation in PWH. Targeting DNAm at the ISGs-mediated pathways may provide new therapeutic avenues for addressing HIV-associated chronic inflammation and its many downstream effects. Genes outside the ISG group may also contribute the inflammatory process among PWH. For example, cg07839457 located within the promoter region of NLRCS was previously shown to be hypomethylated in ART-na\u00efve PWH compared to individuals without HIV, and to become significantly hypermethylated after two years of successful ART, although less so than in individuals without HIV46. This hypomethylation has also been observed in adults and children with HIV on ART22,64. In our study, we showed that hypomethylation of cg07839457 (NLRC5) was linked to IL-6, sCD14 and D-dimer levels. This finding supports the hypothesis that the effects of HIV and ART on DNAm at this specific site, are mediated through inflammation. NLRC5 encodes a protein that negatively regulates nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) and type I interferon signaling pathways64, and may serve as a useful target for controlling inflammation in PWH. Further research, ideally with DNAm and inflammatory markers at multiple time points after ART, is needed to elucidate the relationship between DNAm at cg07839457 and persistent inflammation. Other promising genes identified by top CpG sites include FKBP5, which promotes NF-\u03baB pathways,65 and KLHDC7B, which regulates ISGs such as IFITs and", "question": "What is the relationship between DNA methylation at cg07839457 and persistent inflammation?", "answer": "The hypomethylation of cg07839457 (NLRC5) was linked to IL-6, sCD14 and D-dimer levels, suggesting that the effects of HIV and ART on DNA methylation at this specific site, are mediated through inflammation."}
{"context": "Associations between androgen levels and clinical outcomes in women\n\nPotential associations between low androgen levels and cardiovascular disease\n(CVD), mortality, and fractures in women without overt endocrine disease may\nprovide important clues on the potential role of androgen deficiency for the\nincreased risk of these conditions in women with hypopituitarism.\n\nOf note, cross-reactivity with, for example, inflammatory factors has been\nreported for immunoassays, which may result in false positive associations\nbetween androgen levels and disease in women [26]. Only a few studies have\naddressed associations between endogenous androgens measured by MS and CVD\nevents and/or all-cause mortality in population-based cohorts of women. In one\nof those studies in older women [35], it was reported that lower levels of\nDHEA and testosterone were associated with higher risk of incident\ncardiovascular events but not all-cause mortality. In another study no\nassociation was observed between upper quartile levels of DHEA,\nandrostenedione, or testosterone and incident CVD events among postmenopausal\nwomen [36]. In middle-aged women, higher DHT but not testosterone levels were\nassociated with increased risk of all-cause mortality [37] whereas, in another\nstudy [38], no associations between androstenedione or testosterone and\nincident 10-year CVD or mortality risk among was found. Thus, studies of the\nassociation between high-quality measurements of androgen levels and CVD risk\nin women are few and report mixed results.\n\nThe main mechanism underlying CVD is atherosclerosis and a few recent MS-based\nstudies lend support for a relation between low androgen levels and\natherosclerosis in women. Among 2950 older women, lower testosterone and\nandrostenedione levels were associated with a higher degree of coronary artery\ncalcification, even after multivariate adjustment [39]. In women older than 55\nyears, lower DHEA and androstenedione were associated with increased carotid\nintima-media thickness after adjustment for traditional risk factors and DHEA\nwas inversely associated with peripheral arterial disease [36]. In accordance\nwith these clinical data, we have previously shown that AR deficiency in\nfemale mice results in increased atherosclerosis [40].\n\nImportantly, the interpretation of association studies of androgen levels and\noutcomes in women is complicated by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),\naffecting 5\u201318% of all women [41]. In PCOS, high levels of all androgens [42]\ncoexist with an adverse cardiometabolic risk profile [41]. Some studies\nsuggest that the relation between DHEA and testosterone with cardiovascular\nrisk in women is U-shaped [43, 44], suggesting that both low and high androgen\nlevels may be associated with CVD.\n\nThe effects of androgens on bone health are well known and low serum\ntestosterone has been shown to be associated with low bone mineral density\n(BMD) in both middle-aged and older women [45\u201347]. The relative role of direct\nAR-mediated effects of testosterone on female bone and effects that depends on\nits aromatase-mediated conversion to estradiol remains unclear [48].\nGenetically predicted higher serum DHEA-S was recently shown to increase\nlumbar BMD and decrease forearm fracture\n\n", "question": "What is the association between low androgen levels and cardiovascular disease in women?", "answer": "Lower levels of DHEA and testosterone were associated with higher risk of incident cardiovascular events but not all-cause mortality."}
{"context": "widely examined molecules are miRNAs, which are short, internal, non-coding\nRNAs. Their role in regulating gene expression after transcription and\ntranslation is remarkable and has attracted considerable attention (Zhang J.\net al., 2015; Jabalee et al., 2018) (Figure 4). Evidence suggests that miRNA\nexchange among tumor and stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment,\nespecially with regards to lung cancer, could be responsible for the\ninitiation and development of the cancer (Adi Harel et al., 2015; Liu Y. et\nal., 2016; Sun et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019a).\n\nAngiogenesis, which is essential for the expansion and spread of tumors, is\nregulated by exosomes that are released by different cell types and act as\nmessengers between cells (Zhang L. et al., 2015). A recent study suggested\nthat exosomal miR-9 may encourage blood vessel growth through the activation\nof the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (Zhuang et al., 2012). The tissue inhibitor\nof metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) increased exosomal miR-210 originating from\nlung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) samples, leading to the promotion of angiogenesis\nin stromal cells (Cui et al., 2015). Liu et al. also found that miR-21, which\nis located within exosomes, activated signal transducer and activator of\ntranscription (STAT) 3, which then led to enhanced expression of vascular\nendothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the transformation of normal human\nbronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) into malignant cells (Liu Y. et al., 2016).\nAt the end, it was shown that exosomal miR\u201023a obtained from lung cancer cells\nhad the capability of boosting tumour vascularization in environments with\neither normal or low oxygen, suggesting that lung cancer cells are capable of\npassing on genetic material to remote endothelial cells (Hsu et al., 2017).\n\nImmune checkpoint proteins are extremely important in controlling the immune\nsystem in order to keep the body in balance and keep it from attacking itself\n(Smolle et al., 2019). Treating advanced NSCLC patients with medications which\nfocus on the immune checkpoint molecules PD-1 and PD-L1 has been linked to\ngreater lifespans (Arbour and Riely, 2019). Research has revealed that miRNAs\ncan act as a network to regulate processes associated with immune checkpoint\npathways. One example is miR-34, which is managed by p53 and directly binds to\nthe PD-L1 3\u2032UTR, ultimately suppressing its presence in non-small cell lung\ncancer models (Cortez et al., 2016). The function of MiR\u2010200 was additionally\nfound to regulate the expression of PD\u2010L1 (Chen et al., 2014).\n\nMore and more research suggests that exosomes play a role in cancer growth by\ntransferring molecules and substances that weaken the body\u2019s defences\n(Greening et al., 2015). MiRNAs that are packaged into exosomes are pivotal in\nmodulating the activities of various immune cells, particularly dendritic\ncells and T-lymphocytes, in the context of cancer (Sun et al., 2018). For\ninstance, as mentioned above, exosomes from lung cancer cells have been seen\nto transfer miR\u201021/29a to set off TLR7 and TLR8 on immune cells, which could\nbe linked to cancer proliferation and metastasis (Fabbri et al., 2012).

The most prevalent subtype\nof thyroid cancer, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), typically presents as a\nslowly progressing tumor and carries the most favorable overall prognosis [3].\nIn contrast, a small proportion of thyroid carcinomas, such as poorly-\ndifferentiated PTC (PDPTC), MTC, and ATC, exhibit high aggressiveness and even\nlethality [4]. Conventional treatments for thyroid cancer include surgical\nintervention, radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, and thyroid stimulating\nhormone suppression therapy, either alone or in combination [5]. Furthermore,\ntargeted therapies and antiangiogenic multikinase inhibitors are approved for\nthyroid cancer recently [6]. However, there is a paucity of effective\ntreatment options available for patients with advanced thyroid cancer.\n\nPrevious studies have postulated that the distinct prognosis is a result of\nintricate interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironment [7].\nIndeed, immunotherapy utilizing immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD1,\nPD-L1, and CTLA4 has emerged as a well-established option for cancer treatment\nin recent decades [8]. Similarly, active trials of immunotherapy are underway\nin patients with thyroid cancer and have shed light on the potential of this\ntreatment approach for advanced cases.

However, no significant\ndifferences were discerned between the two deep cryopreservation methods\nconcerning intact primordial follicle proportion, DNA fragmentation\nproportion, or average primordial follicle density.\n\nHowever, regardless of the freezing method, all of them face the risk of\ndamage to cells and tissues caused by ice crystal re-formation and the toxic\ndamage of CPA such as DMSO [83]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for\neffective methods to reduce ice crystal formation and to perform rapid and\nuniform rewarming to improve cryopreservation efficiency.\n\nFunctional impairments in transplantation\n\nIn addition to damage during freezing and rewarming, ovarian tissue also faces\nsignificant challenges after transplantation.

Furthermore, it\ninhibits FGFR3-induced cancer cell migration of CSF1-differentiated\nmacrophages [297].\n\nThere is also a significant focus on studying TLRs as a potential target for\nrestoring the M1 phenotype. These receptors regulate the reprogramming of\nTAMs. Specifically, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7/8, and TLR9 are known to enhance the\nimmunological control of malignant diseases, converting M2-type TAMs into the\nM1 phenotype thereby limiting tumour progression [303\u2013305]. Currently,\nclinical trials involving TLR agonists for tumour therapy are underway. For\ninstance, a completed Phase II study examined the TLR9 agonist MGN1703 in\nsmall-cell lung cancer patients after receiving the first-line chemotherapy\ncycles (NCT02200081) [306]. Despite showing a promising safety profile, no\nsignificant differences in OS and PFS were observed between patients receiving\nMGN1703 (twice-weekly, 60 mg s.c.) and the controls receiving the local\nstandard of care. Another completed Phase I study investigated the combination\nof intravenously administered TLR4 agonist GSK1795091 with other\nimmunotherapies, including pembrolizumab, in 54 patients with advanced solid\ntumours (NCT03447314) although no conclusions could be made regarding this\ncompound\u2019s anti-tumour activity due to the limited data collected [307].\nAnother completed Phase I study from 2021 explored the effect of a TLR7\nagonist, LHC165 (NCT03301896) administered intratumourally as a single agent\n(n = 20), and in combination with the investigational PD-1 inhibitor\nspartalizumab (PDR001) (n = 19) in patients with advanced solid tumours.\nOverall, the combination treatment was shown to be safe and tolerable among\npatients [308].\n\nThe metabolism of M2-type TAMs is characterised by increased glycolysis and\ndecreased oxidative phosphorylation.

Dosimetric Impact of the Magnetic Field on Breast Radiotherapy\n\nOne concern about using MRL for breast radiotherapy is the potential effects\nof the magnetic field on secondary electrons generated by ionizing radiation\nand their subsequent impact on skin dose. The magnetic field causes a\nreduction in the build-up distance due to a curved electron path trajectory,\nwhich results in a decreased entrance depth in tissue [211]. Additionally,\nelectrons exiting the body are subjected to a phenomenon termed the electron\nreturn effect (ERE), where electrons take a circular path in the air and\nreenter the tissue-depositing dose at tissue\u2013air interfaces [211,212]. The ERE\ndose increases with increasing magnetic strength and as such lateral ERE is\nstrongest for a 3T and shows no effect at 0.2T [213]. While diagnostic imaging\nis performed with a 1.5T or 3T MRI, the use of weaker-strength magnetic fields\nsuch as a 0.35T MRI has been used successfully to visualize and track volumes\nduring APBI [209]. ERE can be minimized when using multiple beams such as with\nintensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT); however, breast radiotherapy most\ncommonly employs 3D conformal techniques where opposed oblique fields cover a\nlarge superficial area. This has led to some investigators lending caution to\nthe use of MRL in whole breast irradiation (WBI). Lastly, the electron stream\neffect (ESE) has also been described, where electrons generated in the body\nstart spiraling along the magnetic field towards the head and arm. One way to\nmanage ESE is to shield areas outside of the treatment field with the use of\nbolus to avoid unwanted doses to the skin outside of the field [214].\n\nThese dosimetric concerns regarding local skin dose may be minimalized in APBI\nwhere treatment volumes are small, resulting in less skin involvement. For\nexample, van Heijst et al. compared a seven-field IMRT APBI, a seven-field\nIMRT WBI and a two-field tangent WBI plans in varying magnetic strengths (0T,\n0.35T and 1.5T) and found an increased skin dose with the whole breast plans\nthat was negligible with APBI [215]. Another small study of palliative\npatients with intact tumors in close proximity to skin explored the impact of\nthe magnetic field for different geometric beam arrangements (2\u20133 tangent beam\narrangement, 5-beam IMRT and VMAT) used to deliver hypofractionated APBI (40\nGy in 5 fractions) on a 1.5T MRL [216]. In their APBI analysis, the largest\nvariability between the plan configurations were in skin dose (more noticeable\nfor the 3 mm than the 5 mm skin thickness), which was mitigated by adding\nadditional beam angles. Differences seen between studies may be reflected in\nthe difference in the number of beams, the skin thickness used for analysis or\ntreatment planning systems [216]. Additionally, as noted by Kim et al., heart\nand lung doses were not significantly affected by the magnetic field, although\nthe lung maximum was higher in the magnetic field, possibly due to the\ntissue\u2013air interface at the chest wall. For higher ablative doses, caution\nshould be taken to avoid overdosing the chest wall, which would increase the\nrisk of chest wall pain or rib fracture [217].

An overview of common indications for ICIs is presented in Table 1.\n\n5\\. Molecular Response Assessment in FDG-PET in the Context of ICIs Treatment\n\nThe addition of functional information, such as glucose metabolism, can\nsignificantly improve the assessment of responses. The most spectacular\nexample of functional imaging incorporated into clinical management protocol\nwas HL, where the FDG PET interpreted using the Deauville score brought a\n\u201cparadigm shift\u201d in response evaluation [40]. Metabolic assessment is also\nused in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas (NHL), provided they present with\nsignificantly high glucose uptake (majority of NHL). In several solid tumors,\nsuch as breast cancer, NSCLC, esophageal cancer, and Ewing sarcoma, FDG PET\nhas also been superior at response evaluation compared to pure anatomical\nimaging [41,42,43,44,45]. The classical PET-based criteria to assess metabolic\nresponse in solid tumors\u2014EORTC (European Organization for Research and\nTreatment of Cancer) proposed in 1999 and PERCIST (PET Response Criteria in\nSolid Tumors) proposed by Wahl et al. in 2009 [46,47]\u2014did not refer to\nimmunotherapy. Recently, a few more criteria were established to adjust the\ntreatment response to immunotherapy. These are: PECRIT (PET/CT Criteria for\nEarly Prediction of Response to Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy) [48], PERCIMT\n(PET Response Evaluation Criteria for Immunotherapy) [49], imPERCIST\n(Immunotherapy-modified PERCIST) [50], and iPERCIST (immune PET Response\nCriteria in Solid Tumors) [51].\n\nWhile using FDG PET/CT in response assessment for ICIs, a few critical aspects\nshould be discussed. First, by its nature, a consequence of ICIs treatment is\nan intensification of T lymphocyte infiltration (so-called tumor-infiltrating\nlymphocytes, TILs) into the tumor microenvironment, which may result in its\nparadoxic growth and metabolic activation.

{"context": "and immature dendritic cells (DCs), participate in promoting immune tolerance [8]. Upon metabolic remodeling of the TME, cells react distinctively to nutrient competition. For instance, nutrient deprivation and accumulation of harmful metabolic intermediates can impair the anti-tumor functions of immune cells, which is closely related to the remodeling of tumor-immune landscapes [13]. In this review, we characterize the metabolic state of HCC and elucidate its influence on the immune state of the TME and response to ICIs. Furthermore, trials aimed at enhancing immunologic function or reversing ICI resistance via metabolic intervention are also presented. 2. Impact of Dysregulated Glucose Metabolism in the TME HCC cells reprogram metabolic patterns by adjusting the levels of relevant enzymes and transporting proteins to support glucose uptake, glycolysis, and the discharge of metabolic products, leading to intracellular lactate accumulation and nutrient shortages [14]. Carbohydrate metabolism reprogramming begins at HCC initiation, during which glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) are involved, profoundly influencing the immune landscape. Metabolic alterations in the glycolytic pathway are significant and versatile, involving alterations in various metabolic enzymes and bioactive intermediates. Tumor cells accelerate glycolysis regardless of oxygen availability, which is also called the Warburg effect [2]. With a median oxygen level of 0.8% due to rapid oxygen consumption and abnormal angiogenesis, hypoxia activates the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and upregulates PD-L1 expression. In combination with the lactate-TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, PD-L1 facilitates escape from immune surveillance [15]. Pyruvate kinase isozyme type M2 (PKM2) upregulates HIF-1\u03b1, Gli1, and Bcl-xl expression, enhances cellular proliferation, and PKM2 inhibition restrains glucose uptake. HIF-1\u03b1 impedes immune surveillance and natural killer (NK) cell infiltration by interfering with MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) and inhibiting the expression of natural cytotoxic receptors and the activator NKG2D, thereby interrupting tumor antigen recognition [15,16]. Perforin, interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), and granzyme B secretion is also negatively associated with NKp46 downregulation [17,18]. Lactate accumulation from increased glycolysis leads to TME acidification and disrupts lactate homeostasis under the synergetic influence of oncogenes such as HIF-1, c-myc, and PI3K/AKT [19]. Lactate increases IFN-\u03b3 secretion, leading to T-cell exhaustion via the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. However, abundant lactate impedes the anti-tumor effects of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) by blocking the import transporter MCT-1 while enhancing Tregs by facilitating NFAT1 translocation into the nucleus and augmenting lactate absorption via the upregulation of MCT-1 and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) expression [20]. Thus, enriched Tregs inhibit the release of cytotoxic granzymes and perforin from CD8+ T-cells. They use lactate to support the TCA cycle, mediated by increasing expressions of IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, maintaining proliferation even under hypoglycemic and acidic conditions. In addition, lactate accumulation enhances IL-6- and GM-CSF-regulated MDSC generation possibly", "question": "How does lactate accumulation from increased glycolysis affect the tumor microenvironment?", "answer": "Lactate accumulation leads to TME acidification, disrupts lactate homeostasis, increases IFN-\u03b3 secretion, and impedes the anti-tumor effects of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) while enhancing Tregs."}

Throughout a 24-h day, the strength of the indications and symptoms varies regularly. This also applies to how responsive human beings are to medicine. This is where the idea of chronotherapy enters the picture: administering treatment at the best time of day to maximize therapeutic outcomes (Figure 5). 13. Conclusions This review has highlighted the crucial significance of preserving a circadian rhythm in homeostasis because it regulates different physiological processes over a day. These cycles influence hormone release, physiological functions, sleep\u2013wake cycles, and other bodily processes. By timing medical operations to align with these circadian cycles, chronotherapy aims to reduce side effects and maximize therapeutic efficacy. Thus, this paper explores the intricate relationship between circadian rhythms and chronotherapy, specifically in the context of cancer, and discusses future research targets in this fascinating field. (1) Cancer chronotherapy is a promising field that aims to improve efficacy and reduce negative effects by synchronizing cancer therapies with the body\u2019s circadian cycles [253,254]. (2) The circadian clock and human health are tightly related, with a phenotypic impact that includes illnesses such as cancer disease. In this way, disruptions to the circadian clock could damage both tumor molecular clocks and circadian mechanisms, increasing the cancer risk and cell progression by altering hormone levels, immune function, and metabolic pathways (3) Additionally, the aforementioned results suggest that the molecular clock regularly controls the essential physiological pathways that promote cell proliferation and prevent tumor growth, connecting cell proliferation with mammalian daily physiology. In this sense, it has been demonstrated that an important connection exists between the components of the circadian clock and control of cellular responses to DNA damage, such as repair, checkpoints, and apoptosis. In this way, the elements of the circadian clock particularly influence the onset and spread of cancer. (4) It is becoming clear that clock genes and circadian regulators may be useful therapeutic targets in the fight against cancer. Using pharmaceutical methods (targeting clock proteins) or lifestyle interventions (improving sleep patterns) to modify the circadian clock may provide innovative ways to prevent or treat cancer. Through additional mechanistic studies in multiple cancer processes and pathways, supported by clinical and omics data collected from cancer patients, the functional spectrum of the circadian clock needs to be expanded to influence pharmaceutical therapy. A question also remains regarding how responsive people are to medical treatment. Thereby, chronotherapy comes into play for treating patients during the most effective time of day to optimize their recovery. (5) However, let us not forget that each patient is genetically distinct and therefore has their own circadian rhythm. From a financial point of view, adopting these strategies is a true challenge in the long term to administer treatment according to the circadian characteristics of each patient.

In fact, both cell lines after treatment\nwere affected in the expressions of TUBB4B, TUBB2A, TUBA1C, MCM5, UBC, CDK1,\nCCNE2 and MYC. All these genes are involved in crucial biological processes.\nTUBB4B, TUBB2A and TUBA1C are cellular components of the large family of\nmicrotubule proteins. Alterations at various levels of some of these proteins\ncan cause pathological conditions. Particularly, some of these processes are\ncaused by the malfunction of polymerization and depolymerization of\nmicrotubules, inducing a condition called \u201cdynamic instability\u201d [49]. Studies\nhave shown that TUBB4B plays a role in the maintenance of cancer stem cells\n(CSCs) in oral cancer. The protein is expressed in most normal tissues by\ncytoplasmic expression and is detected in all cell lines and cancer tissues\n[50]. In some cancers such as glioma, carcinoid, and cholangiocarcinoma, weak\nto moderate staining of the protein is observed [50]. Tubulin heterogeneity,\nwhich includes TUBB4B, has also been linked to the development of drug\nresistance in cancer [51]. TUBB2A has been identified as a potential target\nfor cancer therapy due to its role in cancer progression. Several studies have\nreported an association between TUBB2A expression and poor prognosis in\nvarious cancer types, including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and non-\nsmall cell lung cancer [51]. The precise mechanism by which TUBB2A promotes\ncancer progression is still under investigation. One study found that TUBB2A\noverexpression led to increased microtubule stability and resistance to\npaclitaxel-induced cell death in breast cancer cells [52]. Another study\nshowed that TUBB2A overexpression promoted the formation of filopodia, which\nare involved in cancer cell migration and invasion [53]. Targeting TUBB2A may\nrepresent a promising approach for cancer therapy. Several drugs that target\nmicrotubules, such as paclitaxel and vincristine, have been approved for\ncancer treatment. However, these drugs have limited efficacy and can cause\nsevere side effects. TUBA1C plays a role as a tumor promoter in most cancer\ntypes [54]. The overexpression of TUBA1C has been correlated with poor\nprognosis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and is associated with\n13 types of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) in the tumor\nmicroenvironment [55]. Additionally, TUBA1C has been shown to play an\nimportant role in cancer immunity, as its expression positively correlates\nwith stromal and immune cells [56]. In glioma, TUBA1C has been linked to poor\nprognosis and its potential oncogenic mechanisms are currently being\ninvestigated [56]. Overall, TUBA1C appears to be involved in the development\nand progression of various types of cancer and may serve as a potential\nprognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. The MCM5 gene, while not directly\ninvolved in the assembly of the microtubule network, is important for the\nmaintenance of the cellular chromosome compartment. It is overexpressed in\nvarious types of cancer, including breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers,\nand its expression levels have been correlated with poor prognoses in these\ncancers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"\n\n", "question": "What genes are affected in cancer cells after treatment with compound 34?", "answer": "TUBB4B, TUBB2A, TUBA1C, MCM5, UBC, CDK1, CCNE2 and MYC."}

Catecholamines can\nalso re-polarize M1 to M2 macrophages, which leads to the synthesis and\nrelease of IL-10, an immunosuppressive cytokine for the TME. Decreasing\ncatecholamine levels can also shift the immunosuppressive microenvironment by\ndecreasing myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) recruitment, facilitating\ndendritic cell (DC) activation, and increasing the antitumor immune response\nvia the impact on multiple leukocytes [68].\n\nFurthermore, \u03b12-AR agonists enhance antitumor immune responses by diminishing\nthe presence of MDSCs within the tumor microenvironment. This activation leads\nto the recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes within the tumor\nmicroenvironment [69].\n\nSympathetic neural signaling can also directly influence lymphocyte function\n[70]. CD8 effector T cells are the principal cell-killing method in an\nadaptive immune response. When these lymphocytes migrate to a tumor, they are\ncalled tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs)\nare immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment [71,72]. An elevated\nratio of CD8+ T cells to CD4+ Tregs in the tumor microenvironment suggests a\nmore effective antitumor immune response [73]. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a\ncheckpoint receptor expressed on the surface of T cells, including tumor-\ninfiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) [74]. The binding of PD-L overexpressed on\ncancer cells to the PD-1 receptor on T cells diminishes the immune response\nagainst cancer cells. PD-L1 expression on a large number of tumor-associated\nnerves attenuates the antitumor response by decreasing the number of CD8+\ntumor-associated lymphocytes in prostate cancer [75]. Beta-adrenergic\nreceptors (ADRBs) are a type of cell-surface receptor that responds to\ncatecholamines, like norepinephrine and epinephrine [76].

Physalin A effectively suppressed constitutive and induced STAT3\nactivity by inhibiting the phosphorylation of JAK2 and JAK3. In addition,\nPhysalin A prevented the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of\nSTAT3, resulting in a lower expression of STAT3 and its downstream target\ngenes such as Bcl-2 and XIAP [178].\n\nPhysalin A also possesses anti-inflammatory properties by targeting specific\nresidues in IKK-\u03b2, a protein involved in the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.

{"context": "1\\. Introduction\n\nBreast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world and mainly\naffects women, but occasionally it also occurs in men [1]. Many risk factors\nare associated with breast cancer, such as age, familiarity, and genetic\nmutations [2]. Other factors may contribute to breast cancer development, such\nas obesity or hormone therapies [3]. There are different breast cancer\nsubtypes that mainly originate from epithelial cells. Therefore, it is\npossible to distinguish breast cancer as ductal carcinoma (70\u201380%); lobular\ncarcinoma (10\u201315%); and other less frequent types, such as tubular, papillary,\nand mucinous carcinoma [4]. Breast cancer represents a heterogeneous group of\ntumors, and response to therapy is determined by biological features. The\nexpression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal\ngrowth factor receptor 2 allows us to determine the response to therapy [5].\nMoreover, triple-negative breast cancers are characterized by the absence of\nhormone receptors and HER2, and they are categorized as the most aggressive\nsubtype [6]. However, thanks to screening programs and new technologies, today\nthe survival rate has increased significantly. Despite all of these advances\nin breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, there are no currently available\ntreatments for this disease once it metastasizes to distant organs, including\nthe lungs (21\u201332%), bones (30\u201360%), brain (4\u201310%), and liver (15\u201332%) [7].\nMetastatic breast cancer cells that spread to organs with a soft\nmicroenvironment, such as the lung, have been shown to develop resistance to\nchemotherapy treatment in response to the enhancement of redox homeostasis\n[8]. In particular, lung metastases generally occur within five years of\nbreast cancer diagnosis [9]. However, less than 1% of lung cancer instances\nare observed among men. These metastases alter normal lung physiology and are\nvery difficult to treat. In fact, it is estimated that 60\u201370% of patients who\ndie of breast cancer have lung metastasis [10]. In particular, the crosstalk\nbetween primary tumor and early formation of metastatic niches might be\nmediated by extracellular vesicles and tumor/stroma-derived factors [11]. EVs\nare membrane-enclosed vesicles released by all types of cells, and they carry\nvarious types of molecules, such as miRNA, proteins, lipids, and other\nbioactive factors. There is growing evidence that EVs recruit immune cells\ninto the micro-niche of the lungs during chronic inflammatory diseases,\nincluding asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. During this\nprocess, lung epithelial cells are exposed to inflammatory insults, and this\ndamage induces structural re-arrangements of the lung epithelial cells, along\nwith tissue remodeling, including increased metalloproteinase activity and\naltered cytokine levels [12]. Additionally, EVs are involved in the cellular\ncommunication between pulmonary epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages and\nform an important part of lung injury, including diffuse alveolar damage and\nlung epithelial cell death [13].\n\nNowadays, tumor-secreted extracellular EVs emerge among messengers in tumor\nprogression and metastasis formation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"\n\n", "question": "What is the role of extracellular vesicles in lung metastasis?", "answer": "Extracellular vesicles are involved in the cellular communication between pulmonary epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages and form an important part of lung injury, including diffuse alveolar damage and lung epithelial cell death."}

{"context": "1. Introduction. Cancer remains one of the leading causes of human mortality worldwide. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are rare cells released from primary tumors that spread to other organs through the peripheral blood circulation and infect healthy tissues which are essential for metastatic studies and early diagnosis of cancer [1,2]. The isolation, enumeration, and analysis of CTCs are important for clinical applications such as early cancer diagnosis, progression, and assessing the effectiveness of drugs in personalized cancer therapy [3,4]. Collecting and detecting CTCs in the blood is challenging due to their rarity. Microfluidic technologies for CTC separations are of interest because of their low cost, rapid operation, and high throughput. Methods for efficient isolation of CTCs [5,6,7,8] can be categorized into physical sorting and biochemical sorting. Physical methods [9,10,11], including active and passive sorting, mainly utilize the physical properties of tumor cells, such as size density, electric charge, etc. [12,13]. Active physical sorting can achieve high separation efficiency and accuracy, but the need for complex external field assistance (e.g., optical [14], electrical [15,16,17], magnetic [18], or acoustic [19]) greatly raises the cost and inconvenience. To address this challenge, methods for passive separation of CTCs have been introduced [20]. Passive sorting methods rely only on the structure to induce the particles to display different flow states when subjected to hydrodynamic fluids to achieve sorting. According to the different effects produced by the particles, passive sorting techniques can be classified into size-based sorting [21], inertial force sorting [22], deterministic lateral displacement sorting [23], and elastic sorting [24]. Inertial sorting is gradually becoming the mainstream of passive sorting due to its high throughput and convenient operation. The working principle of inertial cell sorting [25,26] is that, under certain fluid conditions, the suspended particles in the fluid experience wall-induced lift, shear-induced lift, and other inertial forces perpendicular to the direction of particles through the channel, resulting in lateral migration. Since particles of different sizes are subjected to different lateral migration forces, they eventually equilibrate to different positions in the micro-channel to achieve focusing, sorting, and enrichment of mixed particles", "question": "What is the purpose of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)?", "answer": "CTCs are essential for metastatic studies and early diagnosis of cancer."}

Similarly, transcriptomic profiles have been reported\nto identify distinct subgroups characterized by different biology and\npotential therapeutic targets [132]. In addition, gene expression profiling,\nsupported by functional analysis in cell lines and animal models, has\nidentified EZH2 as a candidate oncogene in JINET, with important potential\nimplications for therapy, as EZH2 is a target for metformin [133].\n\nAlthough no single genomic alteration has been reported to have a significant\nprognostic or theragnostic value in JINET, the integration of large-scale\nchromosomal abnormalities (copy number alterations, CNA), CDKN1B mutations,\nand CIMP phenotype has proven to be effective in identifying three groups of\ntumors with different prognosis [131]. Specifically, group A, with good\noverall prognosis, was represented by JINET with loss of chromosome 18 and\nCDKN1B mutation but did not show CIMP phenotype. Group B, with intermediate\nprognosis, included JINET with no CNA, no CDKN1B mutation, and CIMP phenotype.\nFinally, group C featured multiple CNA and was characterized by poor prognosis\n[131].\n\nFrom the Bench to the Bedside: Clinical Application of Molecular Knowledge in\nDigestive NEN\u2014Are We Ready for a Molecular Classification of Digestive NEN?\n\nThe medical treatment of digestive NEN is reserved to advanced, inoperable or\nmetastatic, disease and is aimed to prolong patients\u2019 survival. Although it\nmay seem obvious, the most important parameter on which therapy is currently\nbased is the distinction between NEC and NET. In fact, the former are treated\nwith platinum-based chemotherapy combined with etoposide, inspired by the\nsimilarity to their pulmonary counterpart [134, 135], whereas NET are\nbasically resistant to chemotherapy schedules used for epithelial malignancies\ncommonly seen in the digestive tract (i.e., adenocarcinoma) [72]. This\ndifferent response to traditional anti-neoplastic drugs is easily\nunderstandable in the light of the very high proliferation rate of NEC,\ncompared to the distinctively low proliferation rate of NET. However, this is\neveryday experience of clinical practice; NEC invariably recur in a short time\ndespite the initial response to chemotherapy and eventually kill the patient\n[134]. On the other hand, despite the well differentiated morphology, the low\nproliferation index, and the claimed \u201cindolent\u201d behavior of NET, a significant\nproportion of patients experience advanced disease at diagnosis or\nmetachronous metastases and need to be treated with medical therapy [72]. From\nhere, the need to find new and effective therapeutic strategies arises, and\nthe molecular-based therapeutic approach opens new perspectives in this sense.\nThe systematic discussion of the molecular targeted therapeutic strategies\nemployed for NEN is beyond the scope of this article and may be found in\nseveral comprehensive reviews by other authors [see refs 73, 137\u2013139 as non-\nexhaustive examples]. In this paragraph, however, I will review molecular\nalterations representing targets for clinically employable drugs and, thus,\nindividuating classes of neoplasms amenable to different specific therapies.\n\nIn the light of recent acquisition about the molecular landscape of digestive\nNEC, alternative therapeutic strategies to classical chemotherapy and several\n\u201cdruggable\u201d targets have emerged.<p\n\n", "question": "What is the role of EZH2 in JINET?", "answer": "EZH2 is a candidate oncogene in JINET, with important potential implications for therapy, as EZH2 is a target for metformin."}

To address this issue, Ried et al. were the first to apply a principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA)-based approach to estimate principal components (PC)\nrepresenting body shapes derived from BMI, height, weight, WC, HC, and WHR\n[11]. The four derived body shape phenotypes explained over 99% of the total\nvariation in these anthropometric traits and were differently associated with\nseveral indicators of metabolic health (e.g., hormonal, metabolic, and\ninflammatory biomarkers) [11]. This PCA-based approach has been subsequently\napplied by our team to reflect associations of these body shapes with the risk\nof cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition\ncohort (EPIC) [10]. A generally obese body shape and a tall, lean body shape\nwere both positively associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, while\nthe other two body shapes were not associated with such risk [10].\n\nThe underlying biological and metabolic mechanisms linking obesity to BC are\nmultiple and complex. Obesity has been strongly associated with several\nmetabolic alterations, including deregulation of sex hormones, overexpression\nof pro-inflammatory cytokines, insulin resistance, hyperactivation of insulin-\nlike growth factor (IGF) pathways, hypercholesterolemia, as well as excessive\noxidative stress [5, 12\u201314]. Several of these biomarkers (such as serum sex\nhormone-binding globulin (SHBG), IGF-1, testosterone, C-reactive protein\n(CRP)) have also been associated with BC risk [15\u201317]. However, whether these\nbiomarkers mediate the body shape-BC relationship is unknown. Such knowledge\ncould help understand the impact of body shapes on BC risk and possibly\nidentify biological pathways.\n\nThe main objective of the present study was to investigate to what extent the\npresumed associations between body shape phenotypes and postmenopausal BC risk\nare mediated by biomarkers of metabolic health. The candidate biomarkers were\nselected based on their implication in the development of BC, as well as their\nassociations with obesity.\n\nMaterials and MethodsStudy Population\n\nUK Biobank (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) is a prospective cohort study that\nrecruited a total of 502,418 men and women, aged between 39 and 71 years at\nenrollment between 2006 and 2010.
