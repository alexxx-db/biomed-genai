{"context": "] Therefore, non\u2010Ca2+ nanomaterials could also be used to indirectly regulate\nCa2+ overload. For instance, plasma membrane damage can trigger extracellular\nCa2+ influx, causing intracellular Ca2+ overload and inducing cell death.\nAnother approach involves the utilization of nitric oxide (NO) to activate the\noverexpressed ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels in cancer cells, leading to\nabrupt Ca2+ elevation and intracellular Ca2+ overload, which ultimately\ninduces cell apoptosis.\n\n2.1.1Nanoplatform\u2010derived Ca2+ directly triggers Ca2+ overload\n\nMost of the nanomaterials utilized in Ca2+ overload\u2010based cancer therapy are\nCa2+\u2010based nanomaterials.

On the one hand, probiotic supplements might not be effective if exogenous bacteria colonize poorly in the host intestines and last only a short period.

{"context": "learning models classifying variants as CHIP or tumor-derived [192]. Tracking\ntumor-informed mutations can reduce the risk of CHIP, although CHIP mutations\ncan also be present in tumor tissue, especially in cases with low tumor\npurity. Another proposed approach involves differentiating CHIP-derived cfDNA\nfrom ctDNA based on fragment size differences, considering that ctDNA\nfragments are generally considered to be shorter [224]. However, it is\nimportant to consider the diverse cfDNA size populations in human body fluids,\ntheir overlapping origins, and increasing evidence for the presence of cancer\nmutations in various cfDNA size-populations.\n\n2.3.2Preanalytical issues\n\nAs shown in Section 2.2.1, the quest for refining preanalytical conditions,\nmethodologies, and products tailored for ctDNA analysis remains persistent.\nOptimizing and integrating ctDNA assays into clinical settings critically\ndepends on wide-spread standardization and streamlining of preanalytical\nframeworks \u2013 keys to unlocking enhanced assay performance in terms of\nsensitivity, specificity, and robustness [7,49,72,76\u201380,94,225\u2013227]. While\ncommendable attempts have been made toward global alignment of standard\noperating procedures [7,72,93], achieving such standardization is complex,\ndemanding careful consideration of multiple, often overlapping, challenges and\nvariables. Here, we briefly dissect and navigate many of these complexities,\noutlining potential pathways towards a harmonized ctDNA preanalytical\nlandscape.\n\n2.3.2.1Diversity and analytical challenges of ctDNA structures\n\nWhile ctDNA encompasses diverse types and structures, most current\npreanalytical procedures mainly target mono-nucleosomal ctDNA. However, as the\nimportance of various ctDNA structures in signaling cancer becomes clearer,\nthere\u2019s a pressing need for total ctDNA standardization. The challenge lies\nnot just in recognizing the diversity but also in developing tailored\npreanalytical steps that ensure integrity and optimal analysis across all\nctDNA structures (reviewed in [72]). Furthermore, while preanalytical\nstandardization for ctDNA profiling has mainly focused on blood specimens, it\nis essential to refine and establish specific preanalytical procedures for\neach bodily fluid due to the unique characteristics and composition of cfDNA\nmolecules and inherent differences among bodily fluids in terms of stability\nand molecular makeup.\n\n2.3.2.2Commercial proliferation and its consequences\n\nThe development of commercial ctDNA products is influenced by factors such as\nctDNA\u2019s genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity requiring diverse capture and\nanalysis methods; varied laboratory methodological preferences based on\nconsiderations like expertise, ease of use and cost; advancing technology and\nanalysis modalities pushing vendors towards innovation; demand for\ncustomization and flexibility prompting modular and tailored preanalytical\nsystems; and the potential for unique intellectual property due to varied\nscientific principles. Consequently, the market witnesses an overwhelming\ninflux of commercial ctDNA products, including multiple blood collection\ntubes, cfDNA extraction kits, and automated extraction platforms. While\nindividual studies often highlight variable efficiencies among these products,\na comprehensive evaluation remains elusive, complicating product selection and\nstandardization. To navigate this terrain, a combination of independent\nvalidation efforts, centralized databases detailing product efficiencies, and\na regulatory framework ensuring a baseline efficacy is vital.\n\n<sec\n\n", "question": "What is the challenge in standardizing preanalytical procedures for ctDNA analysis?", "answer": "The challenge lies in recognizing the diversity of ctDNA structures and developing tailored preanalytical steps to ensure integrity and optimal analysis across all ctDNA structures.", "id": "PMC11006350-22"}
{"context": "knowledge, our index patient represents the first use of AXL-targeted therapy in ACC, after confirmation of AXL-high IHC. While this is a single patient case, she encouragingly experienced pronounced tumor regression and marked symptom improvement, favorably compared with previous therapies. Even at PD after 12 months, she had lower disease burden and better quality of life than before AXL-directed therapy (Fig 4). The dissociation between the significant clinical and radiologic improvement compared with the BOR of SD highlights important limitations of RECIST in assessing ACC polymetastatic pulmonary and pleural diseases, as use of only two TLs may lead to inaccurate assessments of response.34 In metastatic papillary thyroid cancer, which exhibits similar indolent and polymetastatic behavior, alternative methods of disease evaluation have been proposed, including tumor volume doubling time.35-37 Similar volumetric and metabolic-based response evaluations are being explored in ACC trials.38,39 In addition, considering the prolonged disease course of these patients, who live years with a cumulative increase in pulmonary tumor burden, quality-of-life and symptom management should be integrated into clinical decision making and as end points in clinical trials. The AXL-targeted therapy used in this case was BA3011.15,16,40 The toxicity profile was favorable; she received just over a year of continuous therapy and came off trial for PD, not toxicity. While a causal association cannot be confirmed, the progressive increase in ADA during her last three cycles of treatment might have contributed to decreased ADC activity.41 In conclusion, to our knowledge, our patient is the first reported ACC case treated with AXL-targeted therapy. Her positive P63 IHC identified her ACC-II subtype, known to be AXL high.

A total of 2567 and 3742 proteins were quantified in\nstudy 1 and study 2, respectively. The differences in the two studies are\nlikely due to optimised MS parameter in the LCMS analysis to improve\nquantification in study 2 as well as LCMS performance. Advantages of multiplex\nTMT studies is the low technical variability and reduced number of missing\nvalues in a TMT set. Moreover, the negative effect of possible patient\ndependent lipid co\u2010isolation during exosome isolation on LCMS\u2010analysis and\nquantification is minimised. Quantification reproducibility is less sensitive\nto performance variations of the LCMS systems than for label free\nquantification (LFQ) measurements.
