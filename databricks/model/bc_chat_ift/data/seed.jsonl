Examples: Context: 1 Introduction Breast cancer (BRCA) is one of the most common malignant tumors in women worldwide and a major cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally (Sung et al., 2021). The number of new BRCA cases is on the rise annually across the world, particularly in developing countries. Studies have shown that accounts for approximately 60%\u201390% of BRCA-related deaths are attributed to metastasis of tumor (Dillekas et al., 2019; Krishnan et al., 2021). Thus, early detection is critical for BLCA treatment and prognosis. Mammography and ultrasound have been utilized for standardizing breast lesion risk assessment, among which mammography screening reduced breast cancer mortality by \u223c20% (Screening, 2012; Christiansen et al., 2022). However, they are susceptible to high false positive rates, resulting in unnecessary biopsies. Particularly in case of high-density breast tissue, the detection sensitivity is compromised. Therefore, there is a need for new precise detection methods to compensate for the deficiency in breast lesion detection. The occurrence and progression of tumors are accompanied by a series of reconstruction processes of the genome and epigenome (Chakravarthi et al., 2016; Ushijima et al., 2021). Among them, DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression and chromatin structure in a complex way affecting gene expression. Studies have confirmed that abnormal methylation patterns play an important role in the occurrence and progression of breast cancer and other malignant tumors (Kulis and Esteller, 2010; Ma et al., 2023). Since the DNA methylation modification process precedes protein translation, abnormal methylation patterns can be detected in the early stages of cancer development, and thus DNA methylation markers may have greater value in early diagnosis of breast cancer compared to detecting cancer-related protein expression levels. Currently, the most widely used diagnostic application related to methylation modification is the Sept9 methylation detection for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer based on cell-free DNA (cf- DNA) in peripheral blood (Galanopoulos et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2018), but its accuracy for early diagnosis is less than 80%. For detecting breast cancer, CA153 antigen detection is used as a breast cancer diagnostic method (Stefan- van Staden and van Staden, 2013; Tang et al., 2016). The antigen detected by this assay kit is significantly elevated in the serum of late-stage breast cancer patients. Its effectiveness for early breast cancer diagnosis is also not ideal. Therefore, it is more commonly applied for preoperative detection and monitoring disease progression after surgery. Developing new methods for early breast cancer diagnosis, especially DNA methylation biomarkers, thus has great significance for the implementation of precision medicine for breast cancer. In healthy individuals, 70%\u201380% of CpG sequences are in a methylated state, which is very important for maintaining body functions (Sulewska et al., 2007). In tumor cells, specific genes experience high methylation of CpG islands, termed CpG island methylator phenotype (CpG island methylator phenotype, CIMP). Different tumors have different detection sites for CIMP, but the biological mechanisms and pathogenesis of most CIMPs have not been clearly studied. Therefore, there are no unified identification methods and Question: What cancer antigen is used for detection of breast cancer? Answer: CA 15-3. It is usually significantly elevated in the serum of late-stage breast cancer patients. Context: study, reconstruction timing did not show a significant association with breast complications, and the ESTRO-ACROP target volume delineation method did not affect complications in either two-stage delayed reconstruction or immediate reconstruction subgroups. For implant placement, the differences in breast complications between prepectoral and subpectoral approaches are controversial yet (29\u201331). We do find it reassuring that the rates of breast complications observed in our cohort were generally comparable to those reported in previous studies. Our findings suggest that introducing the new ESTRO-ACROP guideline is feasible for patients who underwent subpectoral reconstruction in terms of breast complications. Based on well-known randomized trials that established hypofractionated regimen as an effective alternative for adjuvant RT after breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy (32\u201335), a multi-institutional study by the Korean Radiation Oncology Group evaluated the feasibility of hypofractionated RT after breast reconstruction. It revealed that hypofractionated PMRT can improve breast reconstruction outcomes (36). Other recent retrospective studies also suggested that a hypofractionated regimen was comparable with a conventional fractionation in terms of breast-related complications, regardless of breast reconstruction type (14) and surgical extent (37). The major difference between the conventional and the 2019 ESTRO-ACROP guidelines is in the definition of the CTV of the chest wall. Whereas prior contouring guidelines generally included the whole implant, the new ESTRO- ACROP guidelines removed it from the CTV in selected patients (16, 18). Of note, in patients with subpectoral implant breast reconstruction, where implants were inserted in the pocket between the pectoral major and minor, a convex strip of subcutaneous and remnant breast tissue between the anterior and skin of the pectoral major was covered. The new ESTRO-ACROP guideline has dosimetric benefits to adjacent normal organs when using modern volume-based planning techniques. Chang et al. compared dosimetric characteristics of patients with left-sided breast cancer between two guidelines in VMAT planning. It revealed that the new target volume delineation method significantly reduced exposure to the heart, left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), and ipsilateral lung, maintaining target coverage, delivery accuracy, and dose heterogeneity compared with conventional delineation (17). Similarly, Milligan et al. also evaluated the changes in normal organ sparing and target coverage with VMAT and pencil-beam scan planning, finding that the ESTRO target has dosimetric advantages to cardiopulmonary organs (18). Previous studies have shown that increasing radiation doses to the heart, left ventricle, and LAD are directly associated with long-term rates of high-grade coronary artery stenosis and acute coronary events (38\u201340). Also, radiation pneumonitis and radiation fibrosis are well-known toxicities caused by RT in patients with breast cancer, which have a correlation with increasing radiation dose to the lung (41, 42). It is noteworthy that the new guideline could minimize RT-induced adverse events, as most patients with breast cancer are expected to have long-term survival. There might be a concern about increasing recurrences at deep chest wall structures, which Question: What are the advantages of the new ESTRO-ACROP guideline?

{"context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021). Alternol was isolated from the fermentation of a mutant fungus obtained from Taxus brevifolia bark (Liu et al., 2020). Previous studies from our group and others demonstrated that Alternol treatment in prostate cancer cells caused a", "question": "What is the function of ER stress sensor IRE1\u03b1?", "answer": "IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021).

{"context": "Introduction\n\nThere is widespread confusion about hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This\nconfusion has occurred primarily because of misinterpretation of results from\nthe Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study conducted in the 1991-early 2000\ntimeframe. The WHI study was suspended because of adverse side effects on the\nstudy participants. Many commentators declared that the concept of HRT was\n\u201cdead\u201d.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAnalysis of the results from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study (1)\nrevealed that participants who took Prempro, a combination of Premarin\n(conjugated equine estrogen) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) had a\nhigher incidence of side effects, including breast cancer and heart attacks,\nthan control group participants who were assigned a placebo. On the other\nhand, hysterectomized participants who took only Premarin had a lower\nincidence of side effects than control group participants who were assigned a\nplacebo. It can therefore be concluded that MPA is the culprit in increasing\nthe likelihood of side effects of HRT, not the estrogen. This article\nconcluded that \u201cOur analysis suggests that failure to differentiate among\npopulations of women and preparations of HT has cost thousands of lives\u201d.\n\nThe USFDA generalized the WHI results to assume that any HRT products were\ndangerous to women's health. The USFDA requires a \u201cblack box\u201d warning on all\nUSFDA-approved HRT products that includes the statement: \u201cA study of women\ntaking an estrogen with a progestin showed a raised risk of heart attack,\nstroke, blood clot, breast cancer, and dementia\u201d.\n\nBecause MPA is a harmful synthetic progestin does not mean that all synthetic\nprogestins are harmful. Another study investigated the effect of HRT\ncontaining the synthetic progestin norethisterone acetate on recently\npostmenopausal women in Denmark (2). The conclusion of the study was \u201cOur\nfindings suggest that initiation of hormone replacement therapy in women early\nafter menopause significantly reduces the risk of the combined endpoint of\nmortality, myocardial infarction, or heart failure. Importantly, early\ninitiation and prolonged hormone replacement therapy did not result in an\nincreased risk of breast cancer or stroke\u201d.\n\nIt seems clear from these two studies that the HRT therapies that do not\ninclude MPA result in improvement in women's cardiovascular health.\nUnfortunately, the USFDA prohibits statements that support the use of any HRT\nformulations to improve cardiovascular health, because they assume that the\nrisks are high, based on the results of the WHI study that included the use of\nMPA.\n\nMany HRT therapies have been approved by the USFDA that consist of\nbioidentical HRT products. The term \u201cbioidentical\u201d means the hormones in the\nproduct are chemically identical to those that the body produces. Estradiol is\na bioidentical estrogen that is available in pills, patches, sprays, creams,\ngels, and vaginal tablets. Transdermal estradiol applications seem to be more\ndesirable than estrogen pills because the estradiol does not go through the\nliver. If the uterus is intact, progestogens are added to the estrogen therapy\nto reduce the risk of cancer of the uterus. Bioidentical progestogen products\ninclude micronized progesterone, such as Prometrium. Recently, the USFDA has\napproved Bijuva, a combination pill that includes both bioidentical estradiol\nand bioidentical progesterone.\n\nCampagnoli et al.

{"context": "Introduction\n\nIn terms of malignancies in women, breast cancer (BC) is the most common and\none of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide1. The mortality of BC\npatients has been significantly reduced by radical surgery, radiotherapy,\nchemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy within the past decade,\nbut many patients still experience recurrence or metastasis, eventually\nleading to death2. The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5. Mitochondria are the key organelles involved in\nmetabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, and maintaining mitochondrial\nintegrity is the absolute basis of oxidative phosphorylation6. In addition,\nprevious studies have also indicated that the number, structure, and function\nof mitochondria often change in malignant tumor cells to meet the needs of\nrapid growth in acidic and anoxic environments7.\n\nAs a key regulatory subunit of mitochondrial integrity, mitochondrial inner\nmembrane protein (IMMT), also known as Mic-60 or Mitofilin8, is not only an\nimportant part of the mitochondrial contact sites and cristae organization\nsystem (MICOS) complex, but it also interacts with members of the SAM (The\nSorting and Assembly Machinery) complex to form the mitochondrial membrane\nspace bridging complex9. Recent studies have linked IMMT to the onset of\nvarious diseases, including cardiomyopathy10, degenerative encephalopathy11\nand kidney injury12. However, research on the significance of IMMT in cancers\nis rare, and the only literature proposed that IMMT expression might be\nrelated to cancer prognosis13,14. To date, few reports have been published on\nthe relationship between IMMT and the development and progression of BC, and\nthe functions of IMMT in BC remains largely undefined.\n\nThe purpose of this investigation was to delve into the potential functions\nand underlying biological processes of IMMT in the development and progression\nof BC. To achieve this objective, bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry\n(IHC) were utilized to determine the prognostic significance of IMMT and its\ncorrelation with clinicopathological parameters in BC patients.

To address this issue, a novel approach involving the development of a modified CAR, termed rCAR, was devised. This modified CAR features mutations in cytoplasmic lysine residues to reduce susceptibility to ubiquitination-induced downregulation. Notably, rCAR demonstrates the ability to resurface on the cell membrane following internalization, thereby maintaining functionality within intracellular compartments. In preclinical mouse tumor models, rCAR T cells exhibit elevated surface CAR expression, enhanced cytotoxicity, prolonged survival, and superior anti-tumor effects compared to conventional CAR T cells (36). In summary, lysosome-targeted cancer immunotherapy offers a multifaceted approach to disrupt tumor-immune interactions within the TME, potentially enhancing therapeutic outcomes. However, significant challenges including selective drug delivery, safety concerns, resistance mechanisms, and the need for elucidation of underlying mechanisms warrant further investigation. This concise summary underscores the central role of the ES in both innate and adaptive immunity and in immunotherapy. Thus, proper function of endolysosomal compartments is crucial for proper regulation of immune response and surveillance. This connection is important to highlight, as impaired immune response and mechanisms that aid cancer cells to escape immune surveillance are prerequisites of cancer. 1.2Impaired ion channel function in cancer cells Impairment and manipulation of endolysosomal function have been shown to be one major mechanism of cells to sustain multiple cancer hallmarks (37). Therefore, one can say that proper lysosomal function is crucial for proper cell function. Lysosomal functionality is maintained by preserving low lysosomal pH and therefore securing enzymatic function through two main protein groups: the more than 60 hydrolytic enzymes located inside the lysosomes and lysosomal membrane proteins (2, 38, 39). The lysosomal membrane proteins and ion channels not only secure acidification of the lysosomal lumen, but also regulate protein imports from the cytosol, fusion with other organelles and transport of degradation products to the cytoplasm (40). The most prominent membrane proteins are the lysosome-associated membrane glycoproteins (LAMPs) and the vacuolar-type H+ ATPase (V-ATPase), an ATP-dependent proton pump. Past research has shown that V-ATPase does not only maintain the required low lysosomal pH (41), but it has become evident that it plays a significant role in cancer (42\u201345). Primarily, V-ATPase has been found to be overexpressed in cancer, which promotes ECM (extracellular matrix) degradation and consequently cancer cell invasion and migration (46). Additionally, inhibition of V-ATPase has been shown to reduce cancer cell proliferation, induce apoptosis and promote mitochondrial fission (43, 47). The unravelling of the role of V-ATPase and hence lysosomal ion homeostasis in cancer progression was followed by multiple clinical trials. However, V-ATPase inhibitors largely failed in clinical trials (48), which shifted the limelight to further lysosomal ion regulators, i.e. ion channels and their potential role in maintaining cancer hallmarks.

{"context": "1Introduction\n\nCompared to general anesthesia and systemic analgesia, regional nerve block\ntechniques provide important strengths, such as decreased side effects and\naccelerated recovery from anesthesia (1). Postoperative pain is an adverse\noutcome resulting in distress to the patient and an increase in the\nconsumption of opioids for rescue analgesia. Due to concern about common and\nsevere side effects of opioids, including sedation, nausea and vomiting,\ndizziness, constipation, and respiratory depression, anesthesiologists are\nalways looking for preferable approaches to improve postoperative pain,\nprolong analgesia, and reduce the administration of opioids. Erector spinae\nplane block (ESPB), a new regional nerve block technique, is a paraspinal\ninterfacial plane block targeting the ventral and dorsal branches of the\nspinal nerve under ultrasonic guidance (2, 3). This local blocking method has\nbeen proven effective for alleviating postoperative pain, decreasing\npostoperative opioid consumption, reducing postoperative stays in the\nhospital, and maintaining hemodynamic stability, with rarely corresponding\ncomplications (4\u20138). However, even with the administration of long-acting LAs,\nthe analgesic effect of ESPB block with LAs alone lasts only 6 to 8 h (9).\n\nDexmedetomidine is a selective \u03b12 agonist that has been proven safe and\neffective when added to LAs to prolong the analgesic effects of the regional\nnerve block and is accompanied by sedation, anti-anxiety, hypnosis, and\ninhibition of perioperative sympathetic excitation (10\u201312). It can prolong the\nduration of a single-shot block by inhibiting nerve conduction (13). Previous\nstudies have demonstrated that adding dexmedetomidine to the brachial plexus\nblocks could accelerate block onset, prolong the duration of sensory block,\nimprove the analgesic effect, and reduce morphine consumption (14). At\npresent, the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in ESPB is not clear. Besides, its\npotential adverse reactions in regional nerve block, such as hypotension and\nbradycardia, limit its use (15). In addition, the efficacy and the side-\nadverse reactions of dexmedetomidine may also be dose-dependent (16).\n\nAlthough previous meta-analyses have discussed the adjuvant pharmacological\neffects of dexmedetomidine in ESPB, they have not summarized any important\nbenefits quantitatively in the clinic (17). Hence, our study aimed to examine\nthe potential of dexmedetomidine at varying concentrations to enhance pain\nmanagement and mitigate side effects in patients undergoing elective surgery\nwith ESPB for perioperative analgesia.\n\n2Materials and methods\n\nOur study followed the PRISMA (18) recommendations in preparing this\nmanuscript.

The latter two subpopulations express CD16, a surface\nreceptor that efficiently facilitates tumor cell killing, even in the absence\nof antibody engagement (68, 70). V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells, isolated from PBMCs of\nhealthy donors, undergo activation, leading to the expression of CD16, a\nphenomenon not observed in their unstimulated counterparts (71). Furthermore,\nwhen TCR-activated V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells are cross-linked to plastic wells with anti-\nCD16 monoclonal antibodies, substantial TNF-\u03b1 production occurs, a response\nmitigated by the addition of soluble anti-CD16 monoclonal antibodies (71).\n\nThe cytotoxic activity of \u03b3\u03b4T cells is also ascribed to the expression of\nTRAIL and FasL, which bind to corresponding receptors on tumor cells (72, 73)\n( Figure 1 ). TRAIL\u2019s interaction with different receptors produces varied\noutcomes: knockdown of TRAIL-Receptor 4(TRAIL-R4) in Colo357 and MDA-MB-231\ncells significantly reduces sensitivity to \u03b3\u03b4T cell-induced cytotoxicity,\nwhereas TRAIL-R4 knock-in HeLa cells show reinforced cytotoxicity (74).\nFurthermore, serum TRAIL levels hold clinical significance, as evidenced in a\nstudy involving eighteen patients with refractory prostate cancer, where\nhigher serum TRAIL levels at nine months correlated with improved clinical\noutcomes (75).

Since glucose utilization is indicative of glycolysis, a metabolic pathway linked to metastasis, we looked to alternative methods to quantify shifts in cellular metabolism due to alignment effects on a broader scale. This was accomplished using lifetime and intensity approaches to quantify single-cell metabolic states. FLIM measurements of NADH suggested that variations in alignment of the cellular microenvironment resulted in significant differences in cellular metabolic signatures. We found that the average fluorescence lifetime values of NADH in both cell lines were consistent with those in the literature [90, 91, 92]. For both cell lines, we observed a decrease in average NADH lifetime for cells on the aligned condition as quantified by the NADH metabolic index.

{"context": "CAFs are induced by cancer cells through TGF-\u03b2, and they create a mechanical\nbarrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth. Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

Such adaptations include enhanced glucose uptake and glycolysis, with a consequent increase in lactate production9,26. Therefore, it is likely that the different effects of multi-node and single-node PAM inhibitors on cellular functions like cell proliferation and migration are linked to different effects on cancer cells\u2019 metabolism. To address this question, we tested the impact of gedatolisib, alpelisib, capivasertib, and everolimus on key metabolic activities.\n\nFirst, we compared the effects of gedatolisib and single-node PAM inhibitors on glucose consumption and lactate production in three BC cells lines with various PIK3CA/PTEN mutational status. After treatment for 20\u201324 h with increasing drug concentrations, the conditioned medium was analyzed for changes in glucose and lactate levels relative to unconditioned medium. As shown in Fig. 5a, b, gedatolisib reduced glucose consumption and lactate production in a dose-dependent manner, and these changes were independent of cell number.

It is\ncharacterized by a dysfunction of two or more organ systems caused at a\nmolecular level by cellular, humoral, and biochemical mediators, which will\nfinally lead to the formation of tissue-damaging end products [1]. Evidence\nsuggests that MODS is among the most important factors that determine the\nsurvival rate in patients with advanced cancer in ICU settings, and therefore,\ncaution should be taken.\n\nIn patients with an underlying malignancy or early stage of disease, a\nsubclinical syndrome of multiple failure organs can occur\u2014a loss of function\nof vital organs, potentially reversible, compensated by the organism with its\nhomeostasis. In the context of breast cancer, the exploration of subclinical\nmultiple organ failure syndrome is of clinical significance because it can\nlead to understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease progression and\nclinical degradation. Ideally, the subclinical phase of breast cancer requires\na comprehensive examination before the onset of clinical manifestations.\nTherefore, investigating this syndrome in breast cancer patients is imperative\nfor early detection, intervention, and personalized patient management.\nUnveiling this subclinical phenomenon also provides a unique opportunity to\nrefine treatment strategies because mastectomy, especially when performed on\nboth breasts, is a well-known QoL-reducing factor described in the literature.\nThus, our study contributes to improved patient outcomes, prolonged survival,\nand enhanced quality of life. Despite substantial research, data about the\nsubclinical multiple organ failure syndrome are scarce, especially in\noncologic patients. Moreover, this concept is not fully understood by\noncologists because of its similar manifestations with adverse reactions of\nintensive antineoplastic therapies (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy,\ncorticosteroids), oncologic emergencies of sepsis, and disseminated\nintravascular coagulation [1]. Due to this lack of research, neither treatment\nnor intervention has proven efficient in preventing or controlling the\ninadequate response of the body in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [2].\n\nRecent large clinical studies have turned their attention to adjuvant\ntherapies to limit the metastasis process, but their effect on how they\nrestrain the tumor from disseminating is still unclear [3]. Despite these\nresults, the actual treatment aims at molecular targets like HER2/neu [4] and\nCDK4/6 inhibitors [5]. However, these key components in molecular aberrations\nin cancerous cells have yet to be proven as a significant factor in the\nprocess of dissemination [6]. Thus, high-quality clinical studies made the\nactual guidelines for breast cancer therapy and the probability of metastasis\nconditioned by molecular markers and predictive statistical models [7].\n\nAs much as prolonging survival, quality of life (QoL) in oncologic patients\nshould not only be carefully monitored from the beginning of the diagnosis but\nalso improved during the disease and treatment [8,9,10].

These findings indicate that a\ncollaborative relationship exists between anxiety, depression and physical\nsymptoms in patients with advanced cancer.\n\nTherefore, in clinical practice, the reciprocal effects of anxiety,\ndepression, and symptom burden should be considered, so interventions on\neither one could impact positively the other one. It means that symptom\nmanagement could improve patients' depression 26 conversely interventions on\nanxiety and depression could reduce symptom burden among cancer patients. 27\n\nUnfortunately, there were a huge gap between the need of symptom management\nand received treatment in patients with advanced cancer. Only 25% of patients\nwere undertaking drug therapy for their symptoms, and only 2.6% of the\npatients were taking psychiatric medication. It is consistent with the\nfounding of Driessen et al. that the domain of psychological issues is the\nmost unmet care need in advanced cancer patients. 17 The low use of drug\ntherapy for symptoms reveals the current clinical reality that patients with\nadvanced cancer do not receive sufficient symptoms management, but also not\nget enough attention on their psychological symptoms and not obtain good\nmental health services. International data also demonstrate that only a small\nproportion of cancer patients with psychological symptoms receive appropriate\ntreatment. 28 ,  29 Inadequate treatment of psychological symptoms may be due\nto clinicians' insufficient understanding of harm of anxiety or depression and\ntheir greater emphasis on physical symptoms rather than psychological\nsymptoms. In addition, current study found the symptom burden were associated\nwith disease stage in advanced cancer; therefore, there should be more\nattention on symptoms management in palliative care.\n\nSeveral underlying mechanisms may lead to the fact that anxiety and depression\nwere associated with symptom burden in cancer patients. Anxiety and depression\nmay result in abnormal hyperactivity HPA axis, elevated cortisol levels,\nrelease of inflammatory markers, less healthy lifestyles and behavior, which\nlead to multiple physical symptoms, and even a higher cancer\u2010specific\nmortality risk for variety types of cancer including CRC. 30 Some studies\nsuggest that the increase in the proportion of physical symptoms in patients\nwith depression may be due to somatosensory amplification, which indicates\nthat depression can affect the perception and evaluation of physical symptoms\nthrough their impact on higher cognitive processing patterns. 11 Although\nsomatosensory amplification is a possible cause for increased proportion, the\nphysical symptoms of patients are actually occurring and painful.

Elevated CP\nfurther promotes HIF1A expression by reducing iron, establishing a positive\nfeedback loop [269]. Given that copper can also induce cuproptosis under\ncertain conditions [106], it would be intriguing to delve deeper into\nelucidating the interplay between cuproptosis and ferroptosis in the context\nof radiotherapy.\n\nFurthermore, targeting regulators of ferroptosis, such as AIFM2 [270],\nglutathione synthetase (GSS), GPX4, FA complementation group D2 (FANCD2), and\nMAF BZIP transcription factor F (MAFF) can sensitize specific cancers to\nradiotherapy-dependent ferroptosis [271\u2013275]. Additionally, radiotherapy\ninduces radiation colitis in patients, affecting their quality of life.\nHowever, an orally administered Pickering emulsion stabilized with halloysite\nclay nanotubes can inhibit ferroptosis, alleviating radiocolitis in vitro and\nin vivo [276].

Over the past decade, the emergence of immunotherapy, especially\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors, has significantly altered the paradigm of tumor\ntreatment; however, only a minority of patients exhibit responsiveness to\nimmunotherapy. Consequently, addressing this challenge necessitates additional\nstrategies to augment immunotherapy efficacy.\n\nRecent research suggests that enhancing ferroptosis responses could\npotentially amplify the effectiveness of immunotherapy. For instance, anti-\nCD274-mediated immunotherapy triggers CD8+ T cells to release IFNG,\nsubsequently inhibiting SLC7A11 and inducing ferroptosis, thereby enhancing\nimmunotherapy in vivo [267]. ACSL4-dependent tumor ferroptosis, induced by the\ncombination of IFN-gamma and arachidonic acid, also triggers CD8+ T cell-\ndependent antitumor immunity [277].

IFIT proteins can develop a functional complex to restrict viral translation and modulate innate immune signaling54. Specifically, IFIT1 molecules bind to an uncapped 5\u2019-ppp on HIV RNA to sequester those RNA while IFIT3 proteins serve to enhance the binding function of IFIT1 molecules54,55. Proteins encoded by genes MX1, OAS2\u20133, IFI27, IRF7 and ISG20 have also been shown to inhibit HIV viral replication by diverse mechanisms56\u201359. On the other hand, proteins PARP9 and IFI44L may contribute to antiviral responses by mitigating STAT1 molecules in the JAK-STAT pathway60,61 while ISG15 functions as a negative regulator of IFN-1 signaling to prevent overt inflammation62.

In another study no\nassociation was observed between upper quartile levels of DHEA,\nandrostenedione, or testosterone and incident CVD events among postmenopausal\nwomen [36]. In middle-aged women, higher DHT but not testosterone levels were\nassociated with increased risk of all-cause mortality [37] whereas, in another\nstudy [38], no associations between androstenedione or testosterone and\nincident 10-year CVD or mortality risk among was found. Thus, studies of the\nassociation between high-quality measurements of androgen levels and CVD risk\nin women are few and report mixed results.\n\nThe main mechanism underlying CVD is atherosclerosis and a few recent MS-based\nstudies lend support for a relation between low androgen levels and\natherosclerosis in women. Among 2950 older women, lower testosterone and\nandrostenedione levels were associated with a higher degree of coronary artery\ncalcification, even after multivariate adjustment [39]. In women older than 55\nyears, lower DHEA and androstenedione were associated with increased carotid\nintima-media thickness after adjustment for traditional risk factors and DHEA\nwas inversely associated with peripheral arterial disease [36]. In accordance\nwith these clinical data, we have previously shown that AR deficiency in\nfemale mice results in increased atherosclerosis [40].\n\nImportantly, the interpretation of association studies of androgen levels and\noutcomes in women is complicated by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),\naffecting 5\u201318% of all women [41]. In PCOS, high levels of all androgens [42]\ncoexist with an adverse cardiometabolic risk profile [41].

{"context": "widely examined molecules are miRNAs, which are short, internal, non-coding\nRNAs. Their role in regulating gene expression after transcription and\ntranslation is remarkable and has attracted considerable attention (Zhang J.\net al., 2015; Jabalee et al., 2018) (Figure 4). Evidence suggests that miRNA\nexchange among tumor and stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment,\nespecially with regards to lung cancer, could be responsible for the\ninitiation and development of the cancer (Adi Harel et al., 2015; Liu Y. et\nal., 2016; Sun et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019a).\n\nAngiogenesis, which is essential for the expansion and spread of tumors, is\nregulated by exosomes that are released by different cell types and act as\nmessengers between cells (Zhang L. et al., 2015). A recent study suggested\nthat exosomal miR-9 may encourage blood vessel growth through the activation\nof the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (Zhuang et al., 2012). The tissue inhibitor\nof metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) increased exosomal miR-210 originating from\nlung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) samples, leading to the promotion of angiogenesis\nin stromal cells (Cui et al., 2015). Liu et al. also found that miR-21, which\nis located within exosomes, activated signal transducer and activator of\ntranscription (STAT) 3, which then led to enhanced expression of vascular\nendothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the transformation of normal human\nbronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) into malignant cells (Liu Y. et al., 2016).\nAt the end, it was shown that exosomal miR\u201023a obtained from lung cancer cells\nhad the capability of boosting tumour vascularization in environments with\neither normal or low oxygen, suggesting that lung cancer cells are capable of\npassing on genetic material to remote endothelial cells (Hsu et al., 2017).\n\nImmune checkpoint proteins are extremely important in controlling the immune\nsystem in order to keep the body in balance and keep it from attacking itself\n(Smolle et al., 2019). Treating advanced NSCLC patients with medications which\nfocus on the immune checkpoint molecules PD-1 and PD-L1 has been linked to\ngreater lifespans (Arbour and Riely, 2019). Research has revealed that miRNAs\ncan act as a network to regulate processes associated with immune checkpoint\npathways. One example is miR-34, which is managed by p53 and directly binds to\nthe PD-L1 3\u2032UTR, ultimately suppressing its presence in non-small cell lung\ncancer models (Cortez et al., 2016). The function of MiR\u2010200 was additionally\nfound to regulate the expression of PD\u2010L1 (Chen et al., 2014).\n\nMore and more research suggests that exosomes play a role in cancer growth by\ntransferring molecules and substances that weaken the body\u2019s defences\n(Greening et al., 2015). MiRNAs that are packaged into exosomes are pivotal in\nmodulating the activities of various immune cells, particularly dendritic\ncells and T-lymphocytes, in the context of cancer (Sun et al., 2018). For\ninstance, as mentioned above, exosomes from lung cancer cells have been seen\nto transfer miR\u201021/29a to set off TLR7 and TLR8 on immune cells, which could\nbe linked to cancer proliferation and metastasis (Fabbri et al., 2012).

The most prevalent subtype\nof thyroid cancer, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), typically presents as a\nslowly progressing tumor and carries the most favorable overall prognosis [3].\nIn contrast, a small proportion of thyroid carcinomas, such as poorly-\ndifferentiated PTC (PDPTC), MTC, and ATC, exhibit high aggressiveness and even\nlethality [4]. Conventional treatments for thyroid cancer include surgical\nintervention, radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, and thyroid stimulating\nhormone suppression therapy, either alone or in combination [5].

It mainly presents with rapid-growing, firm,\nwell-defined, unilateral mass, pain, or overlying skin changes in the fifth or\nsixth decades of life, commonly in females (97.6%) (2). The prognosis of the\npatients, like sarcomas of soft tissue in other organs, depends on the tumor\nsize, depth, site, histological subtype, and patients' age (3).\n\nUndifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), previously defined as malignant\nfibrous histiocytoma, is a rare spindle cell neoplasm of the skin and soft\ntissue, classified into superficial and deep UPS, respectively; like other\nsarcomas, the prognosis is based on tumor's size, depth, and anatomical site\n(4, 5).

Considering the scarcity\nof cases presenting with breast UPS, diagnosis of this entity is challenging\n(6).\n\nHere, we present a woman with a 2-month history of breast mass, misdiagnosed\nas an abscess and mistreated with antibiotics. An ultrasound examination and a\nneedle biopsy provided suspicion of an invasive tumor; finally, the diagnosis\nwas confirmed by a pathological examination of the surgically removed lesion\n(including breast and sentinel lymph nodes).

Programmed freezing, also\nknown as slow freezing [78], refers to the gradual cooling of tissues placed\non a device in liquid nitrogen, which has the advantages of simplicity, high\nefficiency, does not require the use of large quantities of cryoprotectant,\nand can be programmed to control the rate of freezing, and the majority of\nlive births reported so far are from programmed freezing, which is also likely\nto be related to the earlier application of programmed freezing. Ultra-rapid\nfreezing is a freezing technique between vitrification and slow freezing that\nallows the sample vials to be placed directly into liquid nitrogen. It is\nfaster than programmed freezing but also does not involve the application of a\nprogrammed machine while using a lower concentration of cryoprotectants (CPA)\nthan vitrification freezing [79].Currently, ultra-rapid freezing is mainly\nused for embryo and oocyte freezing, and its application in OTC has rarely\nbeen reported.\n\nAs of present, a consensus on the optimal cryopreservation method for OTC-T\nremains elusive.

We followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline for randomized clinical trials. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three study arms using a balanced allocation ratio of 1:1:1. The protocol for this trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTRN12623000033640) and ethical approval was obtained from The University of Sydney\u2019s Human Research Ethics Committee (2022/809). Participants Eligible participants included women aged 70\u201374 years, living in Australia, who had engaged in mammography screening at least once in the past 5 years. Women who had self-reported a current or previous diagnosis of breast cancer were excluded. This age range was chosen as these women would be approaching the upper age limit for cessation of invitation to the program. They were recruited through Qualtrics, a social research company who partners with many panels to recruit individuals who have already signed up to receive surveys. Upon registration, sample providers verify respondent address, demographic information, and email address. They target eligible participants based on specific parameters including age, gender, and location, but do not guarantee national representation among the invites sent or responses received. They use an incentivization system for participation, for which rewards vary (e.g., cash, gift cards, redeemable points, charitable donations). Procedure Qualtrics\u2019 online survey platform was used to administer the questionnaire and piloting was conducted to test the scenarios and questionnaire. Potential participants were sent an email invitation via Qualtrics with general study information, directed to the study landing webpage where they were able to read the participant information statement, screened for eligibility, and then consented to participation. Participants were presented with a hypothetical scenario in which they imagined they had received a standard BreastScreen letter after a recent mammogram which reported that no breast cancer could be seen.

Dosimetric Impact of the Magnetic Field on Breast Radiotherapy\n\nOne concern about using MRL for breast radiotherapy is the potential effects\nof the magnetic field on secondary electrons generated by ionizing radiation\nand their subsequent impact on skin dose. The magnetic field causes a\nreduction in the build-up distance due to a curved electron path trajectory,\nwhich results in a decreased entrance depth in tissue [211]. Additionally,\nelectrons exiting the body are subjected to a phenomenon termed the electron\nreturn effect (ERE), where electrons take a circular path in the air and\nreenter the tissue-depositing dose at tissue\u2013air interfaces [211,212]. The ERE\ndose increases with increasing magnetic strength and as such lateral ERE is\nstrongest for a 3T and shows no effect at 0.2T [213]. While diagnostic imaging\nis performed with a 1.5T or 3T MRI, the use of weaker-strength magnetic fields\nsuch as a 0.35T MRI has been used successfully to visualize and track volumes\nduring APBI [209]. ERE can be minimized when using multiple beams such as with\nintensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT); however, breast radiotherapy most\ncommonly employs 3D conformal techniques where opposed oblique fields cover a\nlarge superficial area. This has led to some investigators lending caution to\nthe use of MRL in whole breast irradiation (WBI). Lastly, the electron stream\neffect (ESE) has also been described, where electrons generated in the body\nstart spiraling along the magnetic field towards the head and arm. One way to\nmanage ESE is to shield areas outside of the treatment field with the use of\nbolus to avoid unwanted doses to the skin outside of the field [214].\n\nThese dosimetric concerns regarding local skin dose may be minimalized in APBI\nwhere treatment volumes are small, resulting in less skin involvement. For\nexample, van Heijst et al. compared a seven-field IMRT APBI, a seven-field\nIMRT WBI and a two-field tangent WBI plans in varying magnetic strengths (0T,\n0.35T and 1.5T) and found an increased skin dose with the whole breast plans\nthat was negligible with APBI [215]. Another small study of palliative\npatients with intact tumors in close proximity to skin explored the impact of\nthe magnetic field for different geometric beam arrangements (2\u20133 tangent beam\narrangement, 5-beam IMRT and VMAT) used to deliver hypofractionated APBI (40\nGy in 5 fractions) on a 1.5T MRL [216]. In their APBI analysis, the largest\nvariability between the plan configurations were in skin dose (more noticeable\nfor the 3 mm than the 5 mm skin thickness), which was mitigated by adding\nadditional beam angles. Differences seen between studies may be reflected in\nthe difference in the number of beams, the skin thickness used for analysis or\ntreatment planning systems [216]. Additionally, as noted by Kim et al., heart\nand lung doses were not significantly affected by the magnetic field, although\nthe lung maximum was higher in the magnetic field, possibly due to the\ntissue\u2013air interface at the chest wall. For higher ablative doses, caution\nshould be taken to avoid overdosing the chest wall, which would increase the\nrisk of chest wall pain or rib fracture [217].

Molecular Response Assessment in FDG-PET in the Context of ICIs Treatment\n\nThe addition of functional information, such as glucose metabolism, can\nsignificantly improve the assessment of responses. The most spectacular\nexample of functional imaging incorporated into clinical management protocol\nwas HL, where the FDG PET interpreted using the Deauville score brought a\n\u201cparadigm shift\u201d in response evaluation [40]. Metabolic assessment is also\nused in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas (NHL), provided they present with\nsignificantly high glucose uptake (majority of NHL). In several solid tumors,\nsuch as breast cancer, NSCLC, esophageal cancer, and Ewing sarcoma, FDG PET\nhas also been superior at response evaluation compared to pure anatomical\nimaging [41,42,43,44,45]. The classical PET-based criteria to assess metabolic\nresponse in solid tumors\u2014EORTC (European Organization for Research and\nTreatment of Cancer) proposed in 1999 and PERCIST (PET Response Criteria in\nSolid Tumors) proposed by Wahl et al. in 2009 [46,47]\u2014did not refer to\nimmunotherapy. Recently, a few more criteria were established to adjust the\ntreatment response to immunotherapy. These are: PECRIT (PET/CT Criteria for\nEarly Prediction of Response to Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy) [48], PERCIMT\n(PET Response Evaluation Criteria for Immunotherapy) [49], imPERCIST\n(Immunotherapy-modified PERCIST) [50], and iPERCIST (immune PET Response\nCriteria in Solid Tumors) [51].\n\nWhile using FDG PET/CT in response assessment for ICIs, a few critical aspects\nshould be discussed. First, by its nature, a consequence of ICIs treatment is\nan intensification of T lymphocyte infiltration (so-called tumor-infiltrating\nlymphocytes, TILs) into the tumor microenvironment, which may result in its\nparadoxic growth and metabolic activation. In this context, a\npseudoprogression should not surprise; however, the criteria should consider\nthe right moment for a reliable response assessment [52]. Second, due to\noverstimulation of the immune system by ICIs, various irAEs may appear (as\nmentioned above), and a reading nuclear medicine physician should be aware of\ntheir possible metabolic patterns in PET imaging, to minimize the risk of\nfalse-positive results. Last, the interpretation of metabolic changes in the\nfollow-up PET scan should not only focus on the tumor and the organs typically\nrelated to irAEs but also analyze other locations, e.g., spleen, where the\nchange in uptake may indirectly predict the response to treatment [53].\n\nMetabolic patterns of typical irAEs and challenges of metabolic imaging in\npatients receiving ICIs are presented in the following paragraph and\nsummarized in <xref ref-type=\"table\"\n\n", "question": "What is the role of FDG PET in response evaluation for breast cancer?", "answer": "FDG PET has been superior at response evaluation for breast cancer compared to pure anatomical imaging."}

{"context": "and immature dendritic cells (DCs), participate in promoting immune tolerance [8]. Upon metabolic remodeling of the TME, cells react distinctively to nutrient competition. For instance, nutrient deprivation and accumulation of harmful metabolic intermediates can impair the anti-tumor functions of immune cells, which is closely related to the remodeling of tumor-immune landscapes [13]. In this review, we characterize the metabolic state of HCC and elucidate its influence on the immune state of the TME and response to ICIs. Furthermore, trials aimed at enhancing immunologic function or reversing ICI resistance via metabolic intervention are also presented. 2. Impact of Dysregulated Glucose Metabolism in the TME HCC cells reprogram metabolic patterns by adjusting the levels of relevant enzymes and transporting proteins to support glucose uptake, glycolysis, and the discharge of metabolic products, leading to intracellular lactate accumulation and nutrient shortages [14]. Carbohydrate metabolism reprogramming begins at HCC initiation, during which glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) are involved, profoundly influencing the immune landscape. Metabolic alterations in the glycolytic pathway are significant and versatile, involving alterations in various metabolic enzymes and bioactive intermediates. Tumor cells accelerate glycolysis regardless of oxygen availability, which is also called the Warburg effect [2]. With a median oxygen level of 0.8% due to rapid oxygen consumption and abnormal angiogenesis, hypoxia activates the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and upregulates PD-L1 expression. In combination with the lactate-TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, PD-L1 facilitates escape from immune surveillance [15]. Pyruvate kinase isozyme type M2 (PKM2) upregulates HIF-1\u03b1, Gli1, and Bcl-xl expression, enhances cellular proliferation, and PKM2 inhibition restrains glucose uptake. HIF-1\u03b1 impedes immune surveillance and natural killer (NK) cell infiltration by interfering with MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) and inhibiting the expression of natural cytotoxic receptors and the activator NKG2D, thereby interrupting tumor antigen recognition [15,16]. Perforin, interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), and granzyme B secretion is also negatively associated with NKp46 downregulation [17,18]. Lactate accumulation from increased glycolysis leads to TME acidification and disrupts lactate homeostasis under the synergetic influence of oncogenes such as HIF-1, c-myc, and PI3K/AKT [19]. Lactate increases IFN-\u03b3 secretion, leading to T-cell exhaustion via the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. However, abundant lactate impedes the anti-tumor effects of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) by blocking the import transporter MCT-1 while enhancing Tregs by facilitating NFAT1 translocation into the nucleus and augmenting lactate absorption via the upregulation of MCT-1 and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) expression [20]. Thus, enriched Tregs inhibit the release of cytotoxic granzymes and perforin from CD8+ T-cells. They use lactate to support the TCA cycle, mediated by increasing expressions of IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, maintaining proliferation even under hypoglycemic and acidic conditions. In addition, lactate accumulation enhances IL-6- and GM-CSF-regulated MDSC generation possibly", "question": "How does lactate accumulation from increased glycolysis affect the tumor microenvironment?", "answer": "Lactate accumulation leads to TME acidification, disrupts lactate homeostasis, increases IFN-\u03b3 secretion, and impedes the anti-tumor effects of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) while enhancing Tregs."}

Throughout a 24-h day, the strength of the indications and symptoms varies regularly. This also applies to how responsive human beings are to medicine. This is where the idea of chronotherapy enters the picture: administering treatment at the best time of day to maximize therapeutic outcomes (Figure 5). 13. Conclusions This review has highlighted the crucial significance of preserving a circadian rhythm in homeostasis because it regulates different physiological processes over a day. These cycles influence hormone release, physiological functions, sleep\u2013wake cycles, and other bodily processes. By timing medical operations to align with these circadian cycles, chronotherapy aims to reduce side effects and maximize therapeutic efficacy. Thus, this paper explores the intricate relationship between circadian rhythms and chronotherapy, specifically in the context of cancer, and discusses future research targets in this fascinating field. (1) Cancer chronotherapy is a promising field that aims to improve efficacy and reduce negative effects by synchronizing cancer therapies with the body\u2019s circadian cycles [253,254]. (2) The circadian clock and human health are tightly related, with a phenotypic impact that includes illnesses such as cancer disease. In this way, disruptions to the circadian clock could damage both tumor molecular clocks and circadian mechanisms, increasing the cancer risk and cell progression by altering hormone levels, immune function, and metabolic pathways (3) Additionally, the aforementioned results suggest that the molecular clock regularly controls the essential physiological pathways that promote cell proliferation and prevent tumor growth, connecting cell proliferation with mammalian daily physiology. In this sense, it has been demonstrated that an important connection exists between the components of the circadian clock and control of cellular responses to DNA damage, such as repair, checkpoints, and apoptosis. In this way, the elements of the circadian clock particularly influence the onset and spread of cancer. (4) It is becoming clear that clock genes and circadian regulators may be useful therapeutic targets in the fight against cancer. Using pharmaceutical methods (targeting clock proteins) or lifestyle interventions (improving sleep patterns) to modify the circadian clock may provide innovative ways to prevent or treat cancer. Through additional mechanistic studies in multiple cancer processes and pathways, supported by clinical and omics data collected from cancer patients, the functional spectrum of the circadian clock needs to be expanded to influence pharmaceutical therapy. A question also remains regarding how responsive people are to medical treatment. Thereby, chronotherapy comes into play for treating patients during the most effective time of day to optimize their recovery. (5) However, let us not forget that each patient is genetically distinct and therefore has their own circadian rhythm. From a financial point of view, adopting these strategies is a true challenge in the long term to administer treatment according to the circadian characteristics of each patient.

All these genes are involved in crucial biological processes.\nTUBB4B, TUBB2A and TUBA1C are cellular components of the large family of\nmicrotubule proteins. Alterations at various levels of some of these proteins\ncan cause pathological conditions. Particularly, some of these processes are\ncaused by the malfunction of polymerization and depolymerization of\nmicrotubules, inducing a condition called \u201cdynamic instability\u201d [49]. Studies\nhave shown that TUBB4B plays a role in the maintenance of cancer stem cells\n(CSCs) in oral cancer. The protein is expressed in most normal tissues by\ncytoplasmic expression and is detected in all cell lines and cancer tissues\n[50]. In some cancers such as glioma, carcinoid, and cholangiocarcinoma, weak\nto moderate staining of the protein is observed [50]. Tubulin heterogeneity,\nwhich includes TUBB4B, has also been linked to the development of drug\nresistance in cancer [51]. TUBB2A has been identified as a potential target\nfor cancer therapy due to its role in cancer progression. Several studies have\nreported an association between TUBB2A expression and poor prognosis in\nvarious cancer types, including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and non-\nsmall cell lung cancer [51]. The precise mechanism by which TUBB2A promotes\ncancer progression is still under investigation. One study found that TUBB2A\noverexpression led to increased microtubule stability and resistance to\npaclitaxel-induced cell death in breast cancer cells [52]. Another study\nshowed that TUBB2A overexpression promoted the formation of filopodia, which\nare involved in cancer cell migration and invasion [53]. Targeting TUBB2A may\nrepresent a promising approach for cancer therapy. Several drugs that target\nmicrotubules, such as paclitaxel and vincristine, have been approved for\ncancer treatment. However, these drugs have limited efficacy and can cause\nsevere side effects. TUBA1C plays a role as a tumor promoter in most cancer\ntypes [54]. The overexpression of TUBA1C has been correlated with poor\nprognosis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and is associated with\n13 types of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) in the tumor\nmicroenvironment [55]. Additionally, TUBA1C has been shown to play an\nimportant role in cancer immunity, as its expression positively correlates\nwith stromal and immune cells [56]. In glioma, TUBA1C has been linked to poor\nprognosis and its potential oncogenic mechanisms are currently being\ninvestigated [56]. Overall, TUBA1C appears to be involved in the development\nand progression of various types of cancer and may serve as a potential\nprognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. The MCM5 gene, while not directly\ninvolved in the assembly of the microtubule network, is important for the\nmaintenance of the cellular chromosome compartment. It is overexpressed in\nvarious types of cancer, including breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers,\nand its expression levels have been correlated with poor prognoses in these\ncancers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"\n\n", "question": "What genes are affected in cancer cells after treatment with compound 34?", "answer": "TUBB4B, TUBB2A, TUBA1C, MCM5, UBC, CDK1, CCNE2 and MYC."}

{"context": "of regulation of MDSCs by the ANS is crucial for MDSC formation and\naccumulation at pathological sites such as tumors [67,68]. Catecholamines can\nalso re-polarize M1 to M2 macrophages, which leads to the synthesis and\nrelease of IL-10, an immunosuppressive cytokine for the TME. Decreasing\ncatecholamine levels can also shift the immunosuppressive microenvironment by\ndecreasing myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) recruitment, facilitating\ndendritic cell (DC) activation, and increasing the antitumor immune response\nvia the impact on multiple leukocytes [68].\n\nFurthermore, \u03b12-AR agonists enhance antitumor immune responses by diminishing\nthe presence of MDSCs within the tumor microenvironment. This activation leads\nto the recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes within the tumor\nmicroenvironment [69].\n\nSympathetic neural signaling can also directly influence lymphocyte function\n[70]. CD8 effector T cells are the principal cell-killing method in an\nadaptive immune response. When these lymphocytes migrate to a tumor, they are\ncalled tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs)\nare immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment [71,72]. An elevated\nratio of CD8+ T cells to CD4+ Tregs in the tumor microenvironment suggests a\nmore effective antitumor immune response [73]. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a\ncheckpoint receptor expressed on the surface of T cells, including tumor-\ninfiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) [74]. The binding of PD-L overexpressed on\ncancer cells to the PD-1 receptor on T cells diminishes the immune response\nagainst cancer cells. PD-L1 expression on a large number of tumor-associated\nnerves attenuates the antitumor response by decreasing the number of CD8+\ntumor-associated lymphocytes in prostate cancer [75]. Beta-adrenergic\nreceptors (ADRBs) are a type of cell-surface receptor that responds to\ncatecholamines, like norepinephrine and epinephrine [76]. They are expressed\nin all cells but are overexpressed in multiple cancer types. Importantly, both\ncancer cells and immune cells within the TME can express ADRBs, which means\nthey can respond to catecholamines in ways that could influence cancer\nprogression [77]. \u03b2-blockers block the action of catecholamines on \u03b2-ARs.

Physalin A effectively suppressed constitutive and induced STAT3\nactivity by inhibiting the phosphorylation of JAK2 and JAK3. In addition,\nPhysalin A prevented the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of\nSTAT3, resulting in a lower expression of STAT3 and its downstream target\ngenes such as Bcl-2 and XIAP [178].\n\nPhysalin A also possesses anti-inflammatory properties by targeting specific\nresidues in IKK-\u03b2, a protein involved in the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.

By inhibiting the sprouting and proliferation of human umbilical\nvein endothelial cells (HUVECs), Withaferin A impairs the formation of new\nblood vessels and thus suppresses tumor growth and metastasis [182].\n\nIn addition, Withaferin A has been shown to inhibit activation of the NF-\u03baB\nsignaling pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and\nsubsequent apoptosis or cell death.

Many risk factors\nare associated with breast cancer, such as age, familiarity, and genetic\nmutations [2]. Other factors may contribute to breast cancer development, such\nas obesity or hormone therapies [3]. There are different breast cancer\nsubtypes that mainly originate from epithelial cells. Therefore, it is\npossible to distinguish breast cancer as ductal carcinoma (70\u201380%); lobular\ncarcinoma (10\u201315%); and other less frequent types, such as tubular, papillary,\nand mucinous carcinoma [4]. Breast cancer represents a heterogeneous group of\ntumors, and response to therapy is determined by biological features. The\nexpression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal\ngrowth factor receptor 2 allows us to determine the response to therapy [5].\nMoreover, triple-negative breast cancers are characterized by the absence of\nhormone receptors and HER2, and they are categorized as the most aggressive\nsubtype [6]. However, thanks to screening programs and new technologies, today\nthe survival rate has increased significantly. Despite all of these advances\nin breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, there are no currently available\ntreatments for this disease once it metastasizes to distant organs, including\nthe lungs (21\u201332%), bones (30\u201360%), brain (4\u201310%), and liver (15\u201332%) [7].\nMetastatic breast cancer cells that spread to organs with a soft\nmicroenvironment, such as the lung, have been shown to develop resistance to\nchemotherapy treatment in response to the enhancement of redox homeostasis\n[8]. In particular, lung metastases generally occur within five years of\nbreast cancer diagnosis [9]. However, less than 1% of lung cancer instances\nare observed among men. These metastases alter normal lung physiology and are\nvery difficult to treat. In fact, it is estimated that 60\u201370% of patients who\ndie of breast cancer have lung metastasis [10]. In particular, the crosstalk\nbetween primary tumor and early formation of metastatic niches might be\nmediated by extracellular vesicles and tumor/stroma-derived factors [11]. EVs\nare membrane-enclosed vesicles released by all types of cells, and they carry\nvarious types of molecules, such as miRNA, proteins, lipids, and other\nbioactive factors. There is growing evidence that EVs recruit immune cells\ninto the micro-niche of the lungs during chronic inflammatory diseases,\nincluding asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. During this\nprocess, lung epithelial cells are exposed to inflammatory insults, and this\ndamage induces structural re-arrangements of the lung epithelial cells, along\nwith tissue remodeling, including increased metalloproteinase activity and\naltered cytokine levels [12]. Additionally, EVs are involved in the cellular\ncommunication between pulmonary epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages and\nform an important part of lung injury, including diffuse alveolar damage and\nlung epithelial cell death [13].\n\nNowadays, tumor-secreted extracellular EVs emerge among messengers in tumor\nprogression and metastasis formation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"\n\n", "question": "What is the role of extracellular vesicles in lung metastasis?", "answer": "Extracellular vesicles are involved in the cellular communication between pulmonary epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages and form an important part of lung injury, including diffuse alveolar damage and lung epithelial cell death."}

{"context": "1. Introduction. Cancer remains one of the leading causes of human mortality worldwide. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are rare cells released from primary tumors that spread to other organs through the peripheral blood circulation and infect healthy tissues which are essential for metastatic studies and early diagnosis of cancer [1,2]. The isolation, enumeration, and analysis of CTCs are important for clinical applications such as early cancer diagnosis, progression, and assessing the effectiveness of drugs in personalized cancer therapy [3,4]. Collecting and detecting CTCs in the blood is challenging due to their rarity. Microfluidic technologies for CTC separations are of interest because of their low cost, rapid operation, and high throughput. Methods for efficient isolation of CTCs [5,6,7,8] can be categorized into physical sorting and biochemical sorting. Physical methods [9,10,11], including active and passive sorting, mainly utilize the physical properties of tumor cells, such as size density, electric charge, etc. [12,13]. Active physical sorting can achieve high separation efficiency and accuracy, but the need for complex external field assistance (e.g., optical [14], electrical [15,16,17], magnetic [18], or acoustic [19]) greatly raises the cost and inconvenience. To address this challenge, methods for passive separation of CTCs have been introduced [20]. Passive sorting methods rely only on the structure to induce the particles to display different flow states when subjected to hydrodynamic fluids to achieve sorting. According to the different effects produced by the particles, passive sorting techniques can be classified into size-based sorting [21], inertial force sorting [22], deterministic lateral displacement sorting [23], and elastic sorting [24]. Inertial sorting is gradually becoming the mainstream of passive sorting due to its high throughput and convenient operation. The working principle of inertial cell sorting [25,26] is that, under certain fluid conditions, the suspended particles in the fluid experience wall-induced lift, shear-induced lift, and other inertial forces perpendicular to the direction of particles through the channel, resulting in lateral migration. Since particles of different sizes are subjected to different lateral migration forces, they eventually equilibrate to different positions in the micro-channel to achieve focusing, sorting, and enrichment of mixed particles", "question": "What is the purpose of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)?", "answer": "CTCs are essential for metastatic studies and early diagnosis of cancer."}

Group B, with intermediate\nprognosis, included JINET with no CNA, no CDKN1B mutation, and CIMP phenotype.\nFinally, group C featured multiple CNA and was characterized by poor prognosis\n[131].\n\nFrom the Bench to the Bedside: Clinical Application of Molecular Knowledge in\nDigestive NEN\u2014Are We Ready for a Molecular Classification of Digestive NEN?\n\nThe medical treatment of digestive NEN is reserved to advanced, inoperable or\nmetastatic, disease and is aimed to prolong patients\u2019 survival. Although it\nmay seem obvious, the most important parameter on which therapy is currently\nbased is the distinction between NEC and NET. In fact, the former are treated\nwith platinum-based chemotherapy combined with etoposide, inspired by the\nsimilarity to their pulmonary counterpart [134, 135], whereas NET are\nbasically resistant to chemotherapy schedules used for epithelial malignancies\ncommonly seen in the digestive tract (i.e., adenocarcinoma) [72]. This\ndifferent response to traditional anti-neoplastic drugs is easily\nunderstandable in the light of the very high proliferation rate of NEC,\ncompared to the distinctively low proliferation rate of NET. However, this is\neveryday experience of clinical practice; NEC invariably recur in a short time\ndespite the initial response to chemotherapy and eventually kill the patient\n[134]. On the other hand, despite the well differentiated morphology, the low\nproliferation index, and the claimed \u201cindolent\u201d behavior of NET, a significant\nproportion of patients experience advanced disease at diagnosis or\nmetachronous metastases and need to be treated with medical therapy [72]. From\nhere, the need to find new and effective therapeutic strategies arises, and\nthe molecular-based therapeutic approach opens new perspectives in this sense.\nThe systematic discussion of the molecular targeted therapeutic strategies\nemployed for NEN is beyond the scope of this article and may be found in\nseveral comprehensive reviews by other authors [see refs 73, 137\u2013139 as non-\nexhaustive examples]. In this paragraph, however, I will review molecular\nalterations representing targets for clinically employable drugs and, thus,\nindividuating classes of neoplasms amenable to different specific therapies.\n\nIn the light of recent acquisition about the molecular landscape of digestive\nNEC, alternative therapeutic strategies to classical chemotherapy and several\n\u201cdruggable\u201d targets have emerged.<p\n\n", "question": "What is the role of EZH2 in JINET?", "answer": "EZH2 is a candidate oncogene in JINET, with important potential implications for therapy, as EZH2 is a target for metformin."}

To address this issue, Ried et al. were the first to apply a principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA)-based approach to estimate principal components (PC)\nrepresenting body shapes derived from BMI, height, weight, WC, HC, and WHR\n[11]. The four derived body shape phenotypes explained over 99% of the total\nvariation in these anthropometric traits and were differently associated with\nseveral indicators of metabolic health (e.g., hormonal, metabolic, and\ninflammatory biomarkers) [11]. This PCA-based approach has been subsequently\napplied by our team to reflect associations of these body shapes with the risk\nof cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition\ncohort (EPIC) [10]. A generally obese body shape and a tall, lean body shape\nwere both positively associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, while\nthe other two body shapes were not associated with such risk [10].\n\nThe underlying biological and metabolic mechanisms linking obesity to BC are\nmultiple and complex. Obesity has been strongly associated with several\nmetabolic alterations, including deregulation of sex hormones, overexpression\nof pro-inflammatory cytokines, insulin resistance, hyperactivation of insulin-\nlike growth factor (IGF) pathways, hypercholesterolemia, as well as excessive\noxidative stress [5, 12\u201314]. Several of these biomarkers (such as serum sex\nhormone-binding globulin (SHBG), IGF-1, testosterone, C-reactive protein\n(CRP)) have also been associated with BC risk [15\u201317]. However, whether these\nbiomarkers mediate the body shape-BC relationship is unknown. Such knowledge\ncould help understand the impact of body shapes on BC risk and possibly\nidentify biological pathways.\n\nThe main objective of the present study was to investigate to what extent the\npresumed associations between body shape phenotypes and postmenopausal BC risk\nare mediated by biomarkers of metabolic health. The candidate biomarkers were\nselected based on their implication in the development of BC, as well as their\nassociations with obesity.\n\nMaterials and MethodsStudy Population\n\nUK Biobank (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) is a prospective cohort study that\nrecruited a total of 502,418 men and women, aged between 39 and 71 years at\nenrollment between 2006 and 2010.

In 2013,\nthe Bogyo group reported the design and synthesis of a new class of probes\n(such as probe 59) based on quenched fluorescence activity.123 These systems\ncontain a highly electrophilic phenoxymethyl ketone electrophilic \u201cwarhead\u201d,\nwhich reacts with active site nucleophiles of the analyte.

We observed that serum levels of several cytokines\nincluding IFN-gamma, IL-15, IL-18, CXCL10, CCL7, and CXCL13 were significantly\nupregulated after the second dose but returned to baseline after the fourth\ndose (Fig. 5f). Similarly, we observed CXCL13 expression in the lesions of\npatients with CR (Fig. 4c-4d). Notably at pre-treatment (at \u201cBaseline\u201d), all\ncytokine levels were comparable to the cytokine levels of tumor-free mice\n(Na\u00efve), suggesting that the 2141-V11 Ab led to this systemic immune\nactivation, and not the mere presence of the tumor (Fig. 5f).\n\nGiven the observation that treatment with 2141-V11 was associated with the\npresence of TLS in post-treatment biopsies (Fig. 4), we investigated whether\nCD40 agonism with 2141-V11 would induce the formation of TLS in injected and\nnon-injected tumors using the bilateral E0771 breast tumor model. Multiplex IF\nstaining (B220/CD8a/CD4/CD11c/CD21/Podoplanin) demonstrated that at baseline,\nno TLS were observed in any of the implanted tumors (0/6 baseline tumors; Fig.\n6a, 6c). In the post-treatment samples, TLS were observed only in injected\ntumors with 2141-V11 (5/6); none of the non-injected tumors had presence of\nTLS (0/6) (Fig. 6a-6c). Further characterization of the TLS revealed large\nB220+ B-cell centers surrounded by numerous CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and some\nCD11c+ DCs (Fig. 6d). Quantification of CD21 and podopolanin were\nsubstantially elevated only in injected tumors, supporting the presence of TLS\n(Fig. 6e). Spatial co-localization analysis within the TLS of injected tumors\nrevealed that the closest interactions observed were between B-cells and\nCD11c+, CD8+, and CD4+ T-cells, and also between CD11c+ and CD8+ cells (Fig.\n6f).\n\nAs 2141-V11 led to an abscopal effect in the bilateral E0771 tumor model, we\ncompared the immune landscape between injected and non-injected tumors.

Histopathological types of breast cancer include classic lobular\ncarcinoma, pleomorphic lobular carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, metaplastic\ncarcinoma, apocrine carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, cribriform carcinoma,\nsecretory carcinoma, and neuroendocrine carcinoma [19].\n\nThe available data regarding breast cancer in women from the Middle East and\nNorth Africa (MENA), especially from the Northern Emirates region of the UAE,\nare inconsistent and scarce [15]. Limited data is available for\nhistopathological patterns of breast lesions in the UAE. A previous study was\ndone at University Hospital Sharjah between March 2016 and July 2018. The\nstudy showed that 91% of the cases were diagnosed as benign breast lesions.\nAmong breast cancer cases, the most prevalent type was invasive-ductal\ncarcinoma with hormone-positive receptor molecular subtype [16]. Although the\nprevious study provided information on molecular subtypes of included breast\ncancer cases, little information was shown on grading parameters, and there\nwas no mention of the different types of benign and inflammatory breast\nlesions. More studies are needed to highlight various clinical and\npathological characteristics of breast lesions in the UAE. Such information\nwill help in planning specific preventive strategies, including education, and\ndirecting clinical decision-making.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nThis study utilized a record-based approach, conducting a retrospective review\nof 255 breast biopsy records from the surgical pathology daybooks of the\nhistopathology department at the authors' institute from 2016 to 2021. All\nspecimens submitted to the histopathology laboratory (including core biopsy,\nlumpectomy, and mastectomy) were fixed in a 10% formalin solution, processed\nusing a histokinette automated tissue processor, paraffin-embedded, and\nsectioned at 3-5 microns thickness using a microtome machine before staining\nwith hematoxylin and eosin. The obtained results were analyzed with regard to\nage, sex, and lesion type. Histological classification of breast tumors was\nperformed according to the WHO classification of breast tumors, fifth edition.\nData analysis was conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social\nSciences (SPSS) version 28 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY), and findings\nwere presented through text, tables, and charts.\n\nInclusion criteria\n\nAll breast biopsy reports with a specific histopathological diagnosis within\nthe study period were included.\n\nExclusion criteria\n\nBreast biopsy reports with non-specific histopathological diagnosis or reports\nof improper breast lesion biopsy and none breast proper lesions were excluded.\n\nResults\n\nDuring the five-year period (2016-2021), a total of 255 breast lesions were\nreceived in the histopathology department of Thumbay University Hospital\nLaboratory. The patients' age range was 13-73 years, and most cases (n =\n93/255; 36.5%) were in the 30-39 years category. Among the 255 cases, 239\n(93.7%) were female, while only 16 (6.3%) were male. According to\nhistopathological examination, most of the cases were benign (n = 150/255;\n58.8%), followed by inflammatory lesions (n = 55/255; 21.6%), and the rest was\nmalignant (n = 50/255; 19.6%).

It's estimated that as of 2021, approximately four million cancer deaths have been averted [1].

In this aspect, cardiac arrhythmias can be life-threatening, and rising worry over cancer therapy-related cardiotoxicity has ushered in a new branch of medicine called cardio-oncology [2]. Congenital long QT syndrome, female sex, age over 65, structural heart disorders, and polypharmacy are all major QT prolongation risk factors. Furthermore, drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and electrolyte disbalance due to nausea and vomiting can elevate the risk of QT prolongation and TdP [3,4].

{"context": "As a result, \u03936 is the most effective treatment for breast cancer. 6.3 Analyzing parameter effect on rankings Cumulative values and rankings based on various q values in the 2TLIVq-ROFWA operator are provided in Table 13. This research reveals how q affects the performance and ranking of seven alternatives. q is the parameter of the 2TLIVq-ROFS and always has a positive value because it represents a quantity that cannot be negative (i.e., negative root values can distort the results and make the information complex to evaluate). In the proposed model the values of parameter q are chosen randomly considering their condition to be positive to observe its impact on the final ranking. Trends show that choice outcomes are sensitive to q. Cumulative values for each alternative vary greatly when q changes. Alternative \u03936 regularly outperforms others, with cumulative values increasing with the q level. However, alternative \u03937 typically has the lowest results for different q values, indicating poor performance. This sensitivity to q emphasizes the need to carefully select this parameter in the decision-making process to match context and criterion. Further examination of the Table 13 shows that ranks change with q. Different q values significantly affect the ranking of alternatives, demonstrating the 2TLIVq-ROFWA operator's responsiveness to parameter changes. Notably, alternative \u03936 consistently ranks first for most q values, demonstrating its robust and beneficial performance under a variety of conditions. Conversely, alternative \u03937 frequently gets ranked lower, suggesting its inferior performance in most situations. To make educated judgments using the 2TLIVq-ROFWA aggregation operator, the best q value must be carefully evaluated, taking into consideration the relationship between alternatives and preferences of DMs. To evaluate these rankings' stability under data fluctuations and uncertainties, robustness testing is advised. In summary, the q parameter significantly affects the outcomes utilizing the 2TLIVq-ROFWA operator operator, requiring sensitivity analysis, a deep understanding of decision-making implications, and robustness assessment to ensure reliable rankings under changing data conditions. The visual variation of parameters can be observed in Figure 2.

{"context": "Background\n\nBreast cancer patients with oestrogen receptor-negative (ER-) disease that\nrecur, mostly do so within the first 10 years of follow-up [1]. In contrast,\nER+ breast cancer has an almost linear risk of recurrence up to 20 years from\ndiagnosis [2]. For ER+ disease, standard clinicopathologic features of early\nrecurrence appear to maintain at least some of their significance for late\nrecurrence and one integrative prognostic tool, the CTS5 (Clinical Treatment\nScore after 5 years) has been developed to estimate risk between 5 and 10\nyears after diagnosis in the absence of endocrine treatment beyond 5 years\n[3]. It is also clear that while some genomic profiling tests maintain some\nprognostic significance out to 10 years, this differs between the tests [4,\n5]. Additionally, over the period between 5 and 10 years after diagnosis,\nincreased recurrences have been reported to occur in patients with tumours\nwith high levels of both oestrogen-responsive and proliferation-associated\ngenes [6, 7].\n\nOver recent years, at 5 years from diagnosis, women have had the option to\ncontinue their endocrine therapy (ET) for a further 5 years because of trial\ndata showing the overall benefit of this for reducing recurrence risk [8\u201311].\nThis decision is usually made purely on the basis of clinicopathologic\nfeatures of the primary tumour and patient factors. Given a potentially life-\nlong risk of recurrence and positive data from one clinical trial of endocrine\ntherapy beyond 10 years [11], there remains a need to distinguish those that\nhave a significant risk of recurrence even after completing 10 years of ET.\n\nDespite the long natural history of ER+ breast cancer, little is known about\nthe molecular features that predict for recurrences beyond 10 years. Multiple\nmechanisms have been suggested to underpin the emergence of subclinical\ndisease from apparent dormancy as clinically evident very late recurrence\n[12]. The data that support the proposed mechanisms are almost entirely based\non observations in non-clinical model systems. A recent publication on data\nfrom 3,240 patients with a median follow-up time of 14 years reported\ndifferent patterns of recurrence according to molecular features but in 80% of\ncases the data on distant recurrence (DR) were provided by an algorithmic\nmodel rather than observation [13].\n\nA difficulty of studying molecular predictors of very late recurrence (VLR) is\nthe protracted follow-up time that is required in order to determine whether a\nwoman is truly recurrence free. Studies therefore almost inevitably need to be\nretrospective and require the availability of tissues that have been stored\nfor decades. Additionally, to provide adequate statistical power a large\ninitial sample size is needed owing to the relative rarity of the outcome\nevent. Few studies have therefore been conducted but the large breast cancer\npractise at the Royal Marsden Hospital and its policy of long-term storage of\ntissue biopsies provided the opportunity to do so.\n\nThe aim of this project was to determine whether differences could be\nidentified in gene expression and/or DNA alterations between patients that\neventually developed a VLR compared to those with persistent absence of\nrecurrence. To determine the confidence in the results derived, where data\navailability allowed, we undertook analyses of the METABRIC cohort for\ncomparison [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"\n\n", "question": "What is the risk of recurrence for ER+ breast cancer?", "answer": "ER+ breast cancer has an almost linear risk of recurrence up to 20 years from diagnosis."}

However, risk of recurrence remains\nlinear to at least 20 years and so some but not all women that are recurrence\nfree at 10 years may benefit from continuing treatment. Further risk\nstratification at this point would be useful for the very large numbers of\nwomen reaching the 10-year disease-free timepoint.\n\nThe exploratory nature of the study leads to the observations being largely\nhypothesis generating, but as such, they lay a foundation for further\ninvestigation in the context of larger translational studies.

This suggests the possibility of a greater contribution of\nthe late menarche group to the ongoing downward trend in age at menarche; but\nfactors driving this phenomenon are yet to be identified.\n\nThe global trend toward an earlier onset of puberty over the past half-century\nis thought to be significantly influenced by improvements in nutritional\nstatus and general health, mainly reflected in the increase in childhood BMI\n(12). Likewise, dose-response relationships have been reported between higher\nBMI during childhood and the increased likelihood of early menarche (9, 14).\nAge at menarche was inversely correlated with overweight or obesity (odds\nratio, 0.84) among female high school students in Kuwait (37). A study in\nWhite-European females reported that an increase in BMI by 1.0 kg/m2 at the\nage of 8 years reduces the age at menarche by 0.26 years, and later menarche\nwas correlated with lower odds of childhood obesity (odds ratio, 0.57) (38).\nIn a Danish cohort study, an increase of 5 kg/m2 in BMI was associated with\nmenarche occurring 7.9 months earlier (95% CI, \u20139.0, \u20136.6) (10). Consistent\nwith previous studies, our study revealed that menarche tended to begin\nearlier and faster in females with obesity than in those without obesity,\nunderscoring a possible link between obesity and the timing of menarche. The\ninteraction between leptin, the kisspeptin system, and the peripheral actions\nof adipose tissue through other adipokines and aromatase activity have been\nsuggested as possible factors influencing the timing of puberty onset (39\u201341).\nAdditional potential factors accelerating age at menarche may include\nincreased exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals that mimic, antagonize,\nor interfere with the action of endogenous sex steroids, or possess obesogenic\nproperties (42, 43).\n\nNonetheless, the causal relationship between early menarche and obesity\nremains uncertain. We observed a similar decreasing trend in the age of\nmenarche among non-obese groups, albeit with a lower slope, suggesting that\nobesity may not necessarily be the cause of the early menarche. Emerging\nevidence suggests that early menarche can also be associated with obesity in\nadulthood. Specifically, early menarche was associated with increased risk of\nobesity in adulthood (odds ratio, 1.68) and higher BMI in adulthood, with a\nstandardized mean difference of 0.34 kg/m2 (3, 32). Further longitudinal\nstudies are necessary to elucidate the causal relationship between early\nmenarche and obesity.\n\nThe main strength of our study is that we elucidated the ongoing decreasing\ntrend in age at menarche in recent decades using large nationally\nrepresentative data. We also identified differences in the trends according to\nthe percentiles of age at menarche and obesity status. Through this approach,\nour study provides an in-depth insight into the phenomenon of age at menarche.\nHowever, our study had several limitations.

For DOX, we had six available selections from two different starting\nclones (WT-1 (WGS) and WT-5 (WES)) that were analyzed by WGS (DOX-R1, DOX-R2,\nDOX-R3 (Fig. 2A)) and by WES (DOX-R4a, DOX-R4b and DOX-R5). High allele\nfrequency missense mutations were found in only 11 genes (Table S5). Of note,\nDOX-R2 and DOX-R3 carried mutations in TOP2A at frequencies of 0.89 and 0.87,\nrespectively. TOP2A is the known target of DOX21,33 and is known to play a\nrole in drug resistance33\u201335. The amino acid mutation, Pro803Thr (Fig. 2B,C),\nsits within the principal DNA-binding locus, the DNA-gate, a region conserved\nin type II topoisomerases (TOP2A and TOP2B). It is also adjacent to the\ncatalytic tyrosine (Tyr805), responsible for nucleophilic attack on DNA (Fig.\n2B,C)36. The Pro803 site is highly conserved in metazoans as is TOP2A\ngenerally (Fig. 2D). Examination of the human TOP2A DNA-bound crystal\nstructure suggests that Pro803Thr is a gain of function mutation that may\nblock DOX-intercalated DNA from binding, thus preventing the TOP2A/DNA/DOX\nadduct from poisoning the cell. Alternatively, it could be a loss of function\nmutation, especially as knockdown of TOP2A activity has previously been shown\nto confer DOX resistance in a E\u03bc-Myc mouse lymphoma system37.

One of the most well-known receptors\nof cancer cells is folate receptors (FRs), which are responsible for the\ncellular absorption of folic acid (FA) (vitamin B9). High expression of these\nreceptors has been confirmed in the plasma membrane of some cancer cells\n(breast, ovarian, lung, kidney, brain, and endometrial cancer), while normal\ntissues rarely express FRs15,16. The use of FA ligand on the surface of\ncarriers due to the high tendency of this ligand to bind to its receptor on\nthe surface of cancer cells can cause active transfer and internalization of\ndrug delivery systems specifically to cancer cells. This type of\ninternalization is also called receptor-mediated transfer, which increases\ndrug accumulation in tumor tissue and reduces its side effects on normal\ncells. Furthermore, FA contains functional groups (carboxyl, amine) that can\ninteract with NP surfaces17.\n\nCrocin is the most abundant antioxidant compound of saffron with different\nmedicinal effects such as high antioxidant capacity18, anti-inflammatory\neffects19, anti-cancer effects by inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells\n13, reducing blood fat20, etc. However, crocin\u2019s high sensitivity to\ndegradation by environmental factors and its instability at different pH\nlimits its clinical use.

In the XRD spectra for\nNCC and MCC, the presence of sharp peaks at 2\u03b8 = 22.5\u00b0 indicates the presence\nof crystalline structures within the cellulose samples. This peak suggests\nthat both NCC and MCC possess high crystallinity and regular arrangement of\ncellulose molecules within the crystalline regions. Furthermore, the\nappearance of an additional peak around 15\u00b0 in the XRD spectrum of NCC\nindicates the presence of a hydrogen bonding network within the cellulose\nstructure. This peak is often associated with the ordered arrangement of\ncellulose molecules and specific crystalline planes within the structure. In\nthe case of cellulose, the hydrogen bonding interactions play a crucial role\nin stabilizing the crystalline structure and contributing to the overall\nstability of the material. The appearance of this peak in the XRD spectrum\nsuggests that NCC exhibits a well-defined hydrogen bonding network.\nAdditionally, NCC has a significantly smaller crystal size than MCC. Since NCC\nhas a higher surface area-to-volume ratio than MCC, the hydrogen bonding in\nthis plane becomes more prominent, leading to a stronger signal in the XRD\nspectrum. Besides, the higher Crystallinity Index (CrI) in NCC (66.6%)\ncompared to MCC (61.4%) is a consequence of the acid hydrolysis process in NCC\nsynthesis.

TCF4 undergoes acetylation at K150 in conjunction with CBP, leading to conformational changes in the TCF4-DNA complex [132]. GSK3\u03b2, a component of DC involved in this signaling pathway, has also been identified to undergo acetylation. Studies have demonstrated that the members of sirtuin (SIRT) family of deacetylases including SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT3 can mediate deacetylation to inhibit GSK3\u03b2 activity [114, 115]. It has been discovered that the acetylation of \u03b2-catenin is associated with CBP, p300, and PCAF. Specifically, the acetylation of \u03b2-catenin at K345 is linked to the involvement of p300 [127], while the acetylation of K49 is correlated with CBP [128]. Additionally, both K19 and K49 play crucial roles as essential residues during the acetylation process mediated by PCAF [129]. Notably, \u03b2-catenin acetylation not only enhances its stability by inhibiting ubiquitin-mediated degradation but also promotes its nuclear translocation, strengthens its interaction with TCF, and further augments transcriptional activation of Wnt-dependent genes. The interaction between SIRT6 and FZD4 leads to the suppression of FZD4 transcription by reducing histone H3K9 acetylation in HCC [121]. Similarly, in breast cancer, the overexpression of prostate tumor overexpressed-1 has been found to inhibit DKK1 transcription through the recruitment of histone deacetylase 1(HDAC1) and HDAC2, resulting in decreased levels of histone H3/H4 acetylation at the DKK1 promoter [109].

Interestingly, a published study showed an increased oncogenic SNPs burden in cases with co-occurrence of BC and TC. In patients with double cancers, germline variants were found in PALB2, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, and CHEK2 genes, which are known risk genes associated with BC [38]. Recurrent variants could also be considered founder mutations. The prevalence of founder mutations has been extensively documented for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. These pathogenic variants represent the majority of observed mutations in specific populations and have been confirmed as true founders through analysis of common ancestral haplotypes [39]. In our population of study three Colombian founder mutations, previously described [21], were identified, one in BRCA1 c.5123C > A (A1708E), and two in BRCA2 c.1763_1766delATAA (1991del4) and c.2808_2811delACAA (3034del4). Identification of recurrent pathogenic variants in the ATM gene is of importance, as previous studies have demonstrated that women carrying mutations in this gene have a significantly increased risk of developing BC with a risk similar to that conferred by germline mutations in the BRCA2 gene [40].

Functional validation of this recurrent variant demonstrated an exon skipping, leading to a predicted deletion of 59 amino acids located in the Pincer domain of the ATM protein [41]. The splicing process is an event that most eukaryotes genes go through and is regulated by RNA-Binding Proteins (RBPs), cis-regulatory elements, and trans-acting factors [42].

In addition, VGLL1 overexpression has been shown to increase cell invasion in gastric cancer cells (9). However, the molecular mechanisms leading to these phenotypic changes have not been well-defined. Although its interactions with TEAD4 strongly suggest a primary function for VGLL1 as a co-transcriptional activator, its downstream target genes and potential interactions with other transcription factors are still largely unknown. Using a combination of cellular assays, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq analyses, our study confirmed and extended prior findings by comprehensively assessing the downstream impact of VGLL1 expression in pancreatic, basal-like breast and placenta-derived cancer cells. We showed in all 3 tumor cell lines that downregulation of VGLL1 expression inhibited cell proliferation and invasion capacity. In addition, this study revealed that reduced VGLL1 expression led to a decrease in the transcription of several genes associated with cell growth, invasion, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Interestingly, many of the genes regulated by VGLL1 have not yet been mapped to a specific pathway but may play a substantial role in driving cancer progression. TRIM6-TRIM34, a read-through transcript highly upregulated in the context of VGLL1 expression, encodes a fusion protein with no currently known function. However, TRIM6 and TRIM34 individually encode ubiquitin ligases that may play roles in cancer and placenta development. TRIM6 has been reported to increase cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis in cancer (26\u201330). In addition, it has been linked to maintaining pluripotent embryonic stem cells in mice (45). TRIM34 has been shown to facilitate cell fusion of epithelial cells, also known as multinucleated goblet cells (46). Interestingly, multinucleated trophoblast cells are required for embryo implantation and to develop a fused extravillous trophoblastic cell shell (47). The placenta also contains syncytiotrophoblast cells made up of fused cytotrophoblasts that are responsible for the transport of resources between the mother and fetus (48). Although it is currently unknown if TRIM34 plays a role in placental cell fusion, this gene does show moderate expression within normal human placenta (5). The ASXL2 gene, also shown to be upregulated by VGLL1, is reported to regulate EMT transition during trophoblast differentiation and has been linked to the promotion of tumorigenesis and cell proliferation in a variety of cancer types (31\u201334).

In addition to identifying individual candidate genes under the transcriptional control of VGLL1, ChIP-seq analysis identified chromatin targets throughout the genome capable of specifically interacting with VGLL1.

{"context": "Introduction\n\nBrain metastases represent the most common intracranial tumor in adults [1]. An estimated 20% of all patients with cancer will develop brain metastases [2]. Although brain metastases can occur from any cancer, the three most common primary tumors associated with brain metastases are lung (20\u201356% of patients), breast (5\u201320%) and melanoma (7\u201316%) [3]. Advances in the treatment of primary tumors have led to prolonged life expectancy and therefore increased the probability of developing brain metastases [1]. Although some patients who develop brain metastases remain asymptomatic, many patients show neurological symptoms including headaches, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, focal neurological deficits, epileptic seizures, behavioral changes, and cognitive impairment [3, 4]. The overall prognosis for patients with brain metastases remains poor [5]. Brain metastases account for a disproportionately high percentage of morbidity and mortality among patients with cancer [6], with dismal 2- and 5-year survival rates of 8.1% and 2.4% respectively after diagnosis [3].\n\nConventional local treatment options for brain metastases include surgical resection, Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT), Stereotactic Radiotherapy (SRT), or a combination of these. Surgery is a treatment option for large metastatic brain lesions [7]. With WBRT, the entire brain, including healthy brain tissue, is irradiated with a fractionated treatment regimen. WBRT used to be the standard of care for multiple brain metastases. Since long-term adverse cognitive decline is a common neurotoxic effect in patients who have undergone WBRT, and SRT has become increasingly available, SRT is currently generally performed to avoid these cognitive side effects of WBRT [8, 9]. Some studies found SRT to be an effective treatment option for patients with multiple brain metastases [10\u201314]. As per the joint practice guidelines from the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), SRT is recommended for patients with a limited number (1\u20134) of brain metastases and SRT may be considered for patients with a higher number of brain metastases (5\u201310) with a cumulative tumor volume < 15 ml [191].

The data examining uPAR blockade as a treatment further supports a central role for uPA/uPAR in disease progression and provides newer therapeutic targets for treating disease. 3.1. Oncology Given uPAR\u2019s diminished expression in healthy homeostatic tissues when compared to cancers, the receptor has been targeted as a viable therapeutic option [26]. Due to its role in plasminogen activation and tissue remodeling, allowing cellular invasion and altering immune responses, uPAR provides an avenue for cancer invasion and metastasis. The uPA/uPAR complex increases MMP proteolytic activity and dissolution of ECM barriers, along with enhancing stromal angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment (TME). uPA/uPAR at the leading edge of immune cells may also enhance tumor-associated stromal cells, further increasing cancer growth and/or invasion. Many in vitro and in vivo studies have proven impaired tumor progression, metastasis, and invasion when the proteolytic function of uPA/uPAR is either impaired or inhibited [16,24,195,196]. The negative prognostic value with uPAR stromal expression in multiple cancer types, including colon, breast, and pancreatic cancers, clearly highlights the therapeutic potential of aiming at stromal TME as an adjuvant anti-angiogenic, anticancer treatment [191,192,193,194]. uPAR\u2019s role in the tumor stromal microenvironment, overexpression in non-homeostatic tissue, high expression in aggressive cancer subtypes of poor prognosis, along with the lack of obvious cancer phenotypes when uPAR is deficient, all suggest uPAR as a candidate in anti-tumor cytotoxic therapy. Targeting strategies using uPAR have been employed. uPAR targeting is accomplished using uPA-derived peptides, monoclonal antibodies, and high-affinity receptor-binding fragments of uPA (containing the GFD). As mentioned previously, uPAR plays an important role in malignancy (tumor invasion) and metastasis of breast cancer [66,67,68,135,136].

Surprisingly, G9a depletion in ES cells led to a\nsignificant increase in methylated H3 lysine 4 (H3K4), a mark associated with\ngene activation, regardless of H3K9, suggesting a complex regulatory network\nbalancing gene expression during development [29].\n\nFurther research has elucidated the pivotal role of G9a in bone formation and\nimmune cell differentiation. For example, the interaction of G9a with RUNX2 is\nessential for normal osteoblast development; its regulatory influence on the\nTwist gene is vital for osteogenesis [30,31]. Specifically, Hisashi et al.\nreported that G9a could endogenously bind to RUNX2-related regions; depletion\nof G9a in osteoblasts hindered the binding of RUNX2 to the osteocalcin\npromoters, resulting in the abnormal formation of cranial bones [30]. In\naddition, Higashihori et al. demonstrated that G9a regulated osteogenesis via\nTwist gene repression. They found that Twist1 and Twist2 regulatory regions\ncontained substantial H3K9me2 catalyzed by G9a in primary osteogenic\nmesenchyme from calvaria. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of G9a\ndecreased several osteogenic markers and prevented skeletal differentiation in\nvivo [31].\n\nThe significance of G9a in embryonic development parallels its role in cancer\nbiology [16]. In cancer, aberrant G9a activity can lead to improper gene\nsilencing, similar to its role in silencing developmental genes. However, in\nthe context of cancer, this results in the repression of tumor suppressor\ngenes and the activation of pathways that promote cancer cell proliferation,\nsurvival, and metastasis. Understanding the function of G9a in developmental\nbiology, particularly its ability to dictate cell fate and maintain cellular\nidentity through epigenetic modifications, informs its potential to drive\noncogenesis when dysregulated.\n\nG9a could also contribute to the T helper (Th) cell differentiation. Depletion\nof G9a in Th precursor cells was observed to impair their ability to develop\ninto Th2 cells under exposure to chronic infection. G9a depletion might\nelevate the IL-17A expression via the loss of H3K9me2 in the IL-17A locus,\nthereby mitigating the lineage plasticity capacity of Th precursor cells [32].\n\nUnderstanding the dual roles of G9a in promoting normal development and its\naberrant expressions contributing to cancer allows researchers and clinicians\nto gain a better appreciation of the potential for targeting G9a in cancer\ntherapy.\n\n4\\.

Additionally, the review discusses\nthe substantial challenges associated with targeting the immune\nmicroenvironment for future therapies in pediatric cancers.\n\n2\\. Profiling the Immune Microenvironment of Pediatric Tumors\n\nMany studies have shown that densities of tumor-infiltrating immune cells,\nincluding cytotoxic lymphocytes, MDSC, tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), and\nmast cells in the pediatric TME are strongly associated with immune\nsuppression and anti-tumor immune escape. The TME can be classified into\ndifferent categories based on the presence and distribution of T lymphocytes.\nTME with infiltrated immune cells is referred to as immune-inflamed, whereas\nif T cells are confined to the periphery of the tumor and unable to\neffectively penetrate the tumor mass, it is called immune-excluded. An\n\u201cimmune-desert\u201d TME indicates the complete absence of T cells.\n\nMolecular profiling of the immune microenvironment of high-risk pediatric\ntumors based on Immune Pediatric Signature Score (IPASS), which combines\nimmunohistochemistry staining data of T lymphocytes with RNA and whole-genome\nsequencing, estimated that 31% of high-risk cancers in pediatric patients have\ninfiltrating T cells [23]. In CNS tumors, pediatric gliomas have the most\nT-cell receptor (TCR) clones, while osteosarcoma and neuroblastoma show more\ndiversity in these clones. Having a diverse range of TCR clones suggests a\nstrong immune response [24]. This diversity in TCR repertoires is linked to\nprognosis and response to immune therapy in these tumors. Interestingly, the\nstudy found that tumor mutational burden (TMB) and neoantigen load, which\nreflect genetic changes in cancer cells, did not predict T-cell infiltration\nin pediatric cancers [23]. This implies that the presence of a high TMB or a\nlarge number of neoantigens may not necessarily correlate with increased\nT-cell infiltration and immune response in these cancers.\n\nSimilar findings were observed in a murine-based tumor progression glioma\nmodel that mimics the progression from low-grade gliomas (LGG) to high-grade\ngliomas (HGG) [25]. LGG tumors demonstrated a high level of T-cell homing,\ninfiltration, and secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3), which is an activation\nmarker for T cells, in comparison to HGG tumors. Furthermore, the study found\na significant difference in the proportions of cytotoxic CD8+ and CD4+ T cells\nbetween the LGG and HGG tumor cores. LGG tumors exhibited a higher number of\nCD8+ T cells compared to HGG tumors. However, both LGG and HGG tumors showed\nrelatively small proportions of CD4+ T cells. Moreover, the TME of LGG and HGG\ntumors harbors distinct macrophage clusters exhibiting different phenotypes\n[25]. These macrophages transition from an immune-activated phenotype in LGG\nto an immunosuppressive state in HGG, suggesting their role in immune evasion\nduring different phases of tumor development.\n\nThe ability of TAMs to adopt various functional phenotypes is a critical\nfactor in pediatric tumors, influencing tumor growth, the anti-tumor\n\n", "question": "What are the findings on the characterization of the immune microenvironment in pediatric tumors?", "answer": "Studies have shown that densities of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including cytotoxic lymphocytes, MDSC, tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), and mast cells in the pediatric TME are strongly associated with immune suppression and anti-tumor immune escape.

The resistance in many cancers has been linked to increased\nexpression of excision repair crosscomplementing-1 (ERCC1), a key protein\ninvolved in NER. In support of this, high ERCC1 expression is associated with\na significantly worse progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival\n(OS) in patients with HNSCC, including those treated with cisplatin\n[12,32,33,34]. ERCC1 overexpression may serve as a predictive biomarker for\nresistance and may be tested prior to initiating therapy [31,33]. The repair\nof DSBs can also be mediated by ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR),\nwhich activates checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), leading to cell cycle arrest and\nrepair of the affected DNA. ATR is involved in the response of cancer cells to\nboth chemotherapy and ionizing radiation [35].\n\nThe most well-studied gene involved in carcinogenesis and the response to\ntherapy is TP53. The protein product of the gene, p53, has been described as\nthe \u201cguardian of the genome\u201d, and p53 mutations are thought to be involved in\nabout half of all cancers [36,37,38]. Numerous studies have shown that\nmutations in TP53 are associated with resistance to various anti-cancer\ntreatments and a poorer prognosis [39,40,41]. Interestingly, patients with\nhuman-papilla-virus-positive (HPV+) HNSCC show higher treatment responses and\nbetter survival rates than those who are negative. This may be because HPV+\npatients have low rates of TP53 mutation, likely because HPV\u2019s interaction\nwith wild-type p53 is integral to its proliferation [42]. The wild-type p53\npresent in HPV+ cases may aid in the response to chemotherapy by regulating\nproteins involved in the DNA damage response (DDR). E1 is a viral protein\nproduced in HPV-infected cells that activates both ATR and ATM, which activate\nthe DDR. However, the activated DDR machinery is used to replicate the virus,\nmaking it unavailable to repair damage produced by cisplatin, leading to\nhigher chemosensitivity [43].\n\nIn contrast, 75\u201385% of HPV-negative (HPV-) patients have mutated TP53 [11,43].\nIn a study of 510 HNSCC patients (the majority had oral or oropharyngeal\ncancer), 70.4% of patients had a TP53 mutation, and these patients had a\npoorer OS rates than patients with the wild type gene [44]. Patients with\nmutant TP53 have also been shown to have a reduced response to platinum-based\nchemotherapeutic regimens.

Similar\nresults were obtained with a CAR construct carrying the CD3\u03b6 subunit of TCR\ncontaining three ITAM motifs [245]. In another study with human ovarian cancer\ncells, CAR-M cells also containing an intracellular CD3\u03b6 signalling domain\nwere tested. The created anti-HER2 CAR-M cells expressed pro-inflammatory\ncytokines and chemokines, converted bystander M2-macrophages to M1, enhanced\nantigen presentation, recruited T cells, and were resistant to the action of\nimmunosuppressive cytokines.

The ex vivo approach\nrequires the selection, activation, expansion, and differentiation of CAR-M\ncells. In the in vivo approach, the CAR transgene mixes with nanoparticles to\nform nanocomplexes, which are then injected into the organism to convert TAM\nto CAR-M cells in the TME. Macrophages are very resistant to genetic\nengineering due to their high ability to detect and destroy foreign nucleic\nacids, but the development of genetic manipulation allows bypassing this by\nboth viral and non-viral methods [250,251,252].\n\nPBMCs are a readily available source of monocytic cells.

They found that TGF-\u03b21 inhibits the proliferation of\nMCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells by inducing cell cycle arrest at the\ngrowth 1 (G1) phase. In MCF-7 cells that lack the type II TGF-\u03b2 receptor, this\ninhibitory effect is absent, suggesting that TGF-\u03b21's action depends on this\nreceptor to downregulate CDK2 kinase activity.

Introduction The cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor therapies have transformed the treatment landscape in advanced and metastatic breast cancer (MBC), particularly for the molecular subtype that is defined by the hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2\u2212) status. Clinical trials of CDK4/6 inhibitors have demonstrated remarkable efficacy rates in terms of response rate and progression-free survival benefits [1,2,3]. The national clinical practice guidelines by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) have identified CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib) in combination with endocrine therapy (ET) as the new standard of care and recommend them as the preferred frontline therapy on the basis of category 1 evidence for HR+/HER2\u2212 MBC [4] (NCCN makes no warranties of any kind whatsoever regarding their content, use, or application and disclaims any responsibility for their application or use in any way). Despite the recommendation, there are indications of potential suboptimal utilization of CDK4/6 inhibitors. After the initial growth in their uptake, recent reports indicate a plateaued trend, with no more than two-thirds of eligible women receiving treatment with this class of drugs [5,6]. A recent observational study based on a small, regional population of patients highlighted lower rates of CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy use by geographic region and income [5]. In another study of Medicare patients, CDK4/6 inhibitors were reported to be associated with substantial patient out-of-pocket costs [7]; the cost-sharing burden for novel anticancer medications is also known to be associated with delayed treatment initiation [8]. While an individual patient\u2019s clinical characteristics, such as cancer stage, functional status, and presence of biomarkers or genetic mutations, play a central role in treatment selection, certain social determinants of health (SDOH) (e.g., race, marital status, geographic location) and enrollment characteristics (e.g., participation in the Low-Income Subsidy [LIS] program) may adversely affect the actual delivery of a guideline-concordant cancer treatment [9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. The characteristics of treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors have been described previously in various populations [16,17,18]; however, limited data exist on factors that act as barriers, or facilitators, of treatment initiation with CDK4/6 inhibitors.

Conclusions\nTumour hypoxia represents one of the key factors leading to cancer recurrence, aggressiveness and metastatic spread in solid tumours, including breast cancer. Therefore, the identification and quantification of hypoxia are important elements of personalised treatment planning, irrespective of the therapeutic method involved. Functional imaging has shown great potential in identifying hypoxic subvolumes within tumours in clinical settings, thus this field sees continuous developments. Hybrid imaging techniques add extra value to image interpretation owing to complementary parameters used by each method in evaluating a specific parameter. In this regard, PET-MRI shows great advantage for hypoxia imaging, since both PET and MRI have the potential to evaluate functional properties of cells from the tumour milieu. The most promising evaluated parameters appear to be Ktrans and kep (MRI parameters) due to their ability to supply reliable information on tumour vascular flow, blood flow and vessel permeability. The combination between the above-mentioned parameters and hypoxia-specific parameters (%HF and Ki) would offer an advantage in the evaluation of cellular hypoxia. This overview of the current literature illustrates, through the limited number of studies on breast cancer, the potential of PET-MRI to augment the value of hybrid imaging in the detection of hypoxia. Correlations between PET and MRI parameters, as validated by immunohistochemical data (angiogenesis, hypoxia and cell proliferation-specific parameters), offer new biomarkers that can contribute to a more personalised approach to therapy in this patient group.", "question": "What is the role of tumour hypoxia in breast cancer?", "answer": "Tumour hypoxia is a key factor leading to cancer recurrence, aggressiveness, and metastatic spread in breast cancer."}

Peptide-level alterations including differences in post-translational modifications can be spatially explored with high-resolution mass spectrometry imaging [15,16,17,18,19,20]. While collagen is known to have potential as a prognosticator in DCIS [11], our approach is novel in its ability to spatially define multiple peptide alterations to specific pathological regions. Within this study, we used ECM-targeted MALDI-QTOF imaging to further our understanding of the spatial regulation of the collagen proteome in DCIS and IBC. 2. Results2.1. Study Overview The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the spatial regulation of the fibrillar collagen proteome between high nuclear grade DCIS and IBC pathologies. Twenty-two specimens from seventeen patients were annotated by pathologists as DCIS (n = 9), IBC (n = 4), or containing both DCIS and IBC lesions (n = 8) (Table 1, Figure S1, Tables S1\u2013S3). Of the patients with relevant medical history documentation, the median age of the patients was 58.4 years. A majority of samples were from lumpectomies, with a smaller proportion from mastectomies (Table 1). Tissues were mapped for translational and post-translational collagen regulation using ECM-targeted mass spectrometry imaging across tissue sections to encompass all histopathologic features. A four-sample subset was imaged at high spatial resolutions and used for a detailed investigation of the ECM proteomic profiles of individual DCIS lesions. Proteomic sequencing demonstrated complex variations in the post-translational regulation of fibrillar collagens that could be spatially defined. Additional studies were performed to explore other proteomic features of DCIS pathology using targeted enzymatic approaches coupled to sequencing proteomics (Figure 1).

{"context": "local treatments, such as surgery and radiotherapy, as well as chemotherapy-based systemic therapy, the mainstays of TNBC treatment [20].\n\nThe intense genomic and transcriptional heterogeneity of TNBC is responsible for the complexity of defining appropriate molecular targets in preclinical studies. Burstein et al. proposed, after RNA and DNA profiling, a four-type classification of TNBC (Figure 1): basal-like immuno-suppressed (BLIS), basal-like immuno-activated (BLIA), mesenchymal (MES), and luminal androgen receptor type (LAR) [21]. Lehmann et al. redefined the TNBC subtypes as follows: basal-like (BL1 and BL2), immunomodulatory (IM), MES, and LAR [22]. For each subtype, the following is to be mentioned: BLIS tumors have the worst outcome, while BLIA tumors have the best outcome; the LAR subgroup is defined by specific biomarkers and targets, such as the androgen receptor MUC1 and several estrogens regulated genes. The MES subgroup is defined by IGF1, which is the prostaglandin F receptor [21]. A characteristic of the BL1 subtype is the increased expression of cell cycle and DNA damage response genes. The BL2 subtype is defined by growth factor signaling and myoepithelial markers. As already mentioned, the basal-like subtypes constitute 75% of TNBC. According to studies, basal-like immunosuppressed TNBC subtypes have lower numbers of B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells, resulting in a poorer prognosis.\n\nIn general, all BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are associated with basal-like gene patterns [10]. BRCA-mutated (mBRCA) breast cancer is more probable in individuals with a familial background of breast cancer, those who are younger, and those experiencing concurrent or successive occurrences of breast and ovarian cancer on the opposite side [23]. The IM subtype is composed of genes that encode immune antigens, cytokine, and nuclear immune signal transduction pathways, and likely represents gene expression from both tumor cells and infiltrating lymphocytes. The MES subtype exhibits increased expression of the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and growth factor genes. Luminal gene expression is part of the LAR subtype, and the androgen receptor is a driver of the LAR subtype. Cell lines of each subtype show different sensitivities to the alkylating agent cisplatin. All mentioned subtypes may be targeted with efficient TNBC therapy in the future [21,22].\n\nThere are interesting data about the connection between TNBC and the tumor microenvironment (TME), which contains the extracellular matrix (ECM), vascular endothelial growth factors, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and other molecules important for tumor growth and migration [10].

Resolution\nis the most crucial parameter, describing the ability of the equipment to\ndistinguish details in the sample, and is defined as the minimum distance\nbetween two distinct points in the sample that can be observed as separate\nentities by the observer [90]. This property is determined by the optical\nsystem characteristics, such as the numerical aperture of the objective used,\nbut it is also influenced by the wavelength of the light source used [90].\n\nOptical microscopy is one of the most accessible techniques for visualizing\ncell cultures or tissue sections. The visualization of these structures is\npossible due to the small thickness of the specimens (tens of \u00b5m to sub-10\n\u00b5m), with an ideal lateral resolution for an optical microscope being a\nminimum of 200 nm, with an axial resolution of 500 nm [91]. Biological samples\nappear transparent, and their delineation, or certain cellular organelles such\nas the nucleus, can be observed due to their refractive index being different\nfrom that of the cultivation substrate [92]. To highlight specific cellular\norganelles (within the resolution limits imposed by the technique/equipment),\nspecific stains or an antigen-antibody-based labeling system are used, where\nthe antigen is represented by specific molecules from cellular substructures.\nThis procedure, applied to isolated cells, is called immunocytochemistry and\ninvolves marking certain proteins of interest with a primary antibody against\nthe respective protein (e.g., anti-tubulin antibody that specifically reacts\nwith tubulin in the cellular cytoskeleton). Subsequently, a secondary antibody\nis used against the primary antibody, conjugated with an enzymatic label that\ncatalyzes a color reaction in the substrate (e.g., the primary antibody is\nderived from a mouse, so the secondary antibody must come from another animal,\nand it must also specifically react with primary mouse antibodies).\n\nVisualization of nanoparticles in optical microscopy is not possible if they\ndo not have adequate concentrations and do not aggregate in the intracellular\nenvironment, so these clusters exceed the resolution limit. Often, they are\nvisualized due to light reflection, but specific staining methods can also be\nused, such as Prussian Blue for IONPs [22] (Figure 2) or the reaction with\nNaCl for gold-citrate nanoparticles [93].\n\nThe immunocytochemistry technique can be enhanced using fluorescence\nmicroscopy. This is achieved through a procedure similar to the one described\nearlier, but in this case, secondary antibodies are conjugated with\nfluorophores. By using a confocal system with monochromatic radiation, lateral\nresolution can reach up to 180 nm [94]. Moreover, direct labeling of\nnanoparticles with fluorophores can increase their detection sensitivity and\nspecificity, making it easier to monitor their distribution in cellular\nsubstructures.

Enzymatic Activities of Nanozymes\n\nIn recent years, nanozymes have been reported to exhibit a variety of enzymatic activities, which can decompose H2O2 into highly toxic \u2022OH, or O2, or mimic glutathione peroxidase-like activity to consume glutathione in the TME, thus exerting anti-tumor effects [46,47,48,49]. The most frequently reported enzymatic activities are reviewed below.\n\n3.1. Peroxidase (POD)-Mimicking Activity\n\nPOD catalyzes the generation of highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the TME, showing promise in inhibiting tumor growth [50]. The POD-like activity of nanozymes was detected using 3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), which was oxidized by the produced \u2022OH. And a characteristic peak of oxTMB at 652 nm could be observed. Xie et al. [51] designed a multifunctional metal nanocomposite (PNBCTER) that integrates enzyme catalysis, photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), chemodynamic therapy (CDT), and immunotherapy for targeted cancer therapy (Figure 2a). The catalytic kinetics of the nanozyme were evaluated using a colorimetric reaction (TMB to oxTMB), and the Km and Vmax values were determined to be 4.66 mM and 1.54 \u00d7 10\u22128 Ms\u22121, respectively (Figure 2b). Zhang et al. [52] designed a nanozyme probe (AP-HAI) with high efficiency against lung cancer (Figure 2c). Enzymes, after modification by human serum albumin nanoparticles (AP-H), demonstrate excellent POD-like performance (Figure 2d). The Km and the Vmax values were 19.65 \u03bcM and 7.676 \u00d7 10\u22128 Ms\u22121 (Figure 2e). Zhu et al. [53] prepared a well-dispersed MnOOH nanocatalyst. It exhibits good POD enzymatic activity, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. MnOOH also exhibits CAT enzyme-like activity to catabolize H2O2 supplement O2 to regulate TME and catalyze GSH autooxidation.\n\n3.2. Catalase (CAT)-Mimicking Activity\n\nCAT or CAT mimics have the ability to catalyze the decomposition of two H2O2 molecules to generate O2 and H2O, thereby preventing the accumulation of H2O2 and protecting organisms from oxidative damage caused by H2O2 [54,55]. Some nanomaterial-based nanozymes, such as transition metal oxide and multi-metal doped nanozymes, have been found to exhibit CAT-mimetic activity, causing H2O2 decomposition and continuous O2 production in tumor cells to regulate the hypoxic TME. Fu et al. [56] reported a novel CoO@AuPt nanocatalyst with multiple enzymatic activities, including POD, CAT, and oxidase (OXD) activities, to initiate intracellular hemodynamic responses in response to TME (<xref ref-type=\\\"fig\\\">", "question": "What is the role of peroxidase (POD) in nanozymes?", "answer": "POD catalyzes the generation of highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the TME, showing promise in inhibiting tumor growth."}

Since copper is an essential trace element in the human\nbody and is involved in the functioning of various enzymes, including\ntyrosinase and Cu-Zn SOD [85,86], it is logical to assume that copper-based\nnanomaterials can be utilized to eliminate ROS. Liu and colleagues [87]\ndemonstrated the straightforward and effective one-step synthesis of ultra-\nsmall Cu5.4O NPs (Cu5.4O USNPs) that exhibit diverse enzyme-like properties\nand a wide range of ROS scavenging capabilities for the treatment of ROS-\nrelated diseases. These Cu5.4O USNPs not only function as CAT, SOD, and GSH-\nOXD mimics but also showed protective effects against ROS-induced damage at\nvery low concentrations, leading to significantly improved therapeutic\noutcomes in conditions such as acute liver injury, acute kidney injury, and\nwound healing. Meng et al. [88] created dual-shell structures consisting of\nhollow cuprous oxide and nitrogen-doped carbon (HCONC) (Figure 8a). These\nstructures were specifically designed to serve as nanozymes for oncotherapy\nthrough CDT (Figure 8a,b). The Fenton-like reaction mediated by Cu+ can\neffectively break down H2O2 to produce \u2022OH under relatively mild conditions.\nIn comparison to SCONC, the colorimetric reaction and the ability to generate\n\u2022OH between TMB and HCONC were more pronounced and rapid (Figure 8c,d). Both\nSCONC and HCONC showed Michaelis\u2013Menten and Lineweaver\u2013Burke plots, but the\n\u2022OH generation activity of HCONC was significantly greater than that of SCONC\n(Figure 8e).\n\n4.4. Cerium\n\nThe exceptional catalytic activity of CeO2 nanozymes has led to significant\nadvancements in cancer treatment [89,90]. The rapid conversion between Ce3+\nand Ce4+ results in the generation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of CeO2,\nwhich determines the POD and OXD activities of CeO2 [91,92,93]. Cheng et al.\n[94] designed a stable nanocomposite material (CeO2/Y) modified by highly\ndispersed CeO2 nanoparticles on Y-type zeolite as a carrier and synthesized\nthe CeO2/Y nanocomposite material through a simple wet impregnation method.\nCeO2/Y nanocomposites were also proposed for the first time as an efficient\nPOD-mimicking nanozyme for the accurate detection of H2O2 and glucose. Using\nthis POD-like activity, Cheng and colleagues [95] constructed a novel anti-\ntumor controlled release system (Cu-CeO2 NPs) loaded with breast cancer cell\nmembrane and the clinical anticancer drug DOX for cancer treatment (Figure\n9a). The addition of copper ions to the CeO2 nanozymes resulted in a\nsignificant increase in the Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio, leading to a significant\nimprovement\n\n", "question": "What are the potential therapeutic applications of copper-based nanomaterials?", "answer": "Copper-based nanomaterials have been shown to have potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of ROS-related diseases, such as acute liver injury, acute kidney injury, and wound healing, due to their ability to eliminate ROS and exhibit diverse enzyme-like properties."}

In the case of cells\nreceiving overstimulation, highly expressed BH3-only sensitizers would bind to\nand neutralize Bcl-2 while releasing BH3-only activators to activate Bax,\nthereby inducing apoptosis [46,47]. An increase in the Bax/Bcl2 ratio is\ncommonly used as a marker for apoptotic cell death. In this study, we found\nthat 0.1 nmol GeXIVA[1,2] significantly increased the Bax/Bcl2 ratio in the\ntumor tissue from GeXIVA[1,2]-treated mice. Endoplasmic reticulation (ER)\nstress is generally considered to be an important trigger of intrinsic\napoptosis. ER stress-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis was activated by\nendoplasmic reticulation resident proteins, cleaved ATF6 and enhanced the\nexpression of CHOP [48]. However, there is no change in the expression of ER\nstress-associated proteins after GeXIVA[1,2] treatment in TNBC tumor mice.\nThus, we believed the GeXIVA[1,2]-induced apoptosis was ER stress-independent.\n\nReceptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are crucial upstream for cell proliferation,\nsurvival and apoptosis, in which several signaling pathways are involved, such\nas AKT-mTOR, JAK-STAT3, MAP kinases and NF-\u03baB. Akt is a serine\u2013threonine\nprotein kinase with various downstream mediators related to proliferation,\ndifferentiation, migration, survival and metabolism [49]. The mTOR complex is\ncomprised of two macromolecular complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR\ncomplex 2 (mTORC2). The activation of mTORC1 induces anabolic cell growth by\npromoting mRNA translation, protein synthesis, glucose metabolism and lipid\nsynthesis. The activation of mTORC2 leads to the phosphorylation of AKT, which\nmodulates cell survival and proliferation [50]. Akt/mTOR relays signals from\nseveral RTKs following ligand binding and regulates the release of cell\nproliferative promoters. Among the activation of different types of\nproliferative promoters, transcription factor NF-\u03baB and STAT3 are the most\nprominent regulators [51,52,53]. NF-\u03baB protein has been reported to play a key\nrole in the development of human tumors [54]. The activation of NF-\u03baB in\ncancer is believed to result in enhanced cell proliferation and invasion as\nwell as resistance to apoptosis [55]. STAT3, a STAT family member, is an\noncogenic transcription factor associated with cell survival and proliferation\nand regulates the expression of genes that mediate proliferation [56]. Given\nthe role of the NF-\u03baB and phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) in pro-survival\npathways [57], we examined the effect of GeXIVA[1,2] on NF-\u03baB and p-STAT3 and\nfound that their expressions in tumors were downregulated by GeXIVA[1,2]\ntreatment. Although NF-\u03baB and p-STAT3 are regulated by different mechanisms,\nthey appear to be simultaneously activated by Akt/mTOR. Interestingly, our\nresults also indicated that GeXIVA[1,2] could modulate cell survival Akt/mTOR\nsignaling cascade in 4T1 tumors. Targeting the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway can\nbe a promising strategy for the treatment of cancer [58]. Current evidence has\nrevealed that many polypeptide inhibitors targeting AKT, mTOR and other\nupstream effectors can inhibit cell proliferation [59,<xref\n\n", "question": "What is the effect of GeXIVA[1,2] on NF-\u03baB and p-STAT3?", "answer": "The expressions of NF-\u03baB and p-STAT3 in tumors were downregulated by GeXIVA[1,2] treatment."}

The second pathway, independent of ESCRT, relies on proteins like ALIX and transmembrane proteins to recruit cargoes and facilitate vesicle budding [105]. The third mechanism involves membrane lipid microdomains or lipid rafts, with ceramide playing a crucial role in vesicle membrane bending. Following their formation, MVBs can either fuse with lysosomes for degradation or fuse with the plasma membrane to release exosomes [106]. Medium/large EVs, also known as microvesicles, range in size from 50 to 1000 nm and are released from the cell surface by blebbing from the plasma membrane. Their biogenesis invoves various partners, including small GTPases, Ras-related proteins, and phospholipases, ultimately leading to the recruitment of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphorylation of myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) to induce plasma membrane invagination and EV release [107]. Apoptotic bodies (APOBs), the third subtype of EVs, vary in size and are produced during programmed cell death (apoptosis). APOBs exhibit specific sorting mechanisms for organelles, RNA, and DNA fragments, distinguishing them from other EV subtypes. Despite their association with cell death, APOBs are increasingly recognized for their involvement in various biological processes [108,109]. The PCs within EVs, including proteins like tetraspanins and RNA molecules, are integral to their structure, cargo loading, and function, enhancing their therapeutic potential. Understanding the biogenesis pathways of EVs, from the endosomal pathway for exosomes to direct budding from the plasma membrane for microvesicles, is crucial for both basic research and therapeutic development. Collectively, these milestones have provided a comprehensive background of EVs, illuminating their PCs and potential applications across diverse fields. EVs offer a promising strategy for targeted drug delivery in cancer treatment, especially for delivering 5-FU and natural compounds. These small membrane-bound particles, released by cells, facilitate the transfer of bioactive molecules between cells. Engineered EVs in cancer therapy can directly transport therapeutic agents to cancer cells, thereby enhancing efficacy and minimizing toxicity. They effectively protect cargo, improve drug uptake, and overcome resistance mechanisms while being less immunogenic than synthetic carriers. By delivering 5-FU and PCs to cancer cells, EVs enable reduced drug dosages, fewer side effects, and improved treatment outcomes. This approach synergizes the anticancer effects of drugs with targeted EV delivery for more effective cancer treatment [27]. Moreover, exosomes loaded with natural PCs have shown significant promise in cancer therapy. Milk-derived exosomes carrying curcumin and anthocyanidins have demonstrated enhanced antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effects in models of lung cancer [110]. Similarly, exosomes loaded with withaferin A and paclitaxel exhibit substantial antitumor effects, with withaferin A-loaded exosomes demonstrating twice the tumor inhibitory effect compared to free drug administration [111].

However, our findings suggest that patients with less optimal cosmetic outcomes after mastectomy may retain those outcomes even after PMRT.

It also\npromotes diversification of signal transduction by transmitting information\nfrom activated receptors to signaling pathways with different biological\nfunctions, playing an important role in various human diseases, especially\nmalignant tumors [4\u20136]. GAB2, a major member, is mainly composed of a\npleckstrin homology (PH) domain at the N-terminus, proline-rich motifs, and\nmultiple tyrosine residues [7, 8]. PH domain can identify membrane component,\nespecially phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), contributing to\nmembrane recruitment. Proline-rich motifs contains PXXP domain structure,\nbinding to the proteins which include SH3 domain. Multiple tyrosine residues\ncan combine with with SH2 domain structure of the protein [9], such as SHP2,\nthe Crk adaptor protein and the regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85 [5]. GAB2\nphosphorylates under the stimulation of cytokines. The phosphorylated GAB2\ncombines with the p85 subunit of PI3K, and then plays a role in promoting\ncancer [10]. It has also been reported that phosphorylated GAB2 can also\nactivate RAS/ERK signaling pathway and promote the occurrence and development\nof tumors [11]. Thus, the role of GAB2 in tumor is related to its\nphosphorylation. GAB2 has characteristics related to oncogenes and plays a\nsignificant role in the occurrence and development of various malignant\ntumors. Researches have shown that GAB2 highly expressed in breast cancer,\ncolorectal cancer, bladder cancer, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer and other\ntumors [12]. Horst et al. found that GAB2 promoted the proliferation,\nmigration, and metastasis of melanoma cells in vivo by activating the PI3K/AKT\nsignaling pathway [13]. GAB2 had abnormal expression in breast cancer and cell\nlines. Overexpression of GAB2 in human breast epithelial cell line (MCF10A)\npromoted cell proliferation [14].\n\nIn this study, we used data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-\nTissue Expression (GTEx) to investigate the expression of GAB2 and its\nrelationship with prognosis. We also analyzed GAB2 mutations and copy number\nchanges. Subsequently, we further analyzed the compounds that interact with\nGAB2 using molecular docking, and examined the relationship between GAB2 and\nimmune infiltration.

To optimize tumor immunotherapy, transition\nmetal oxide nanomaterials (TMOs), such as titanium oxide, manganese oxide,\niron oxide, and zinc oxide, are extensively utilized to modulate tumor\nimmunity cycle, namely, antigen presentation, priming, and activation, immune\ncell trafficking and infiltration, cancer cell recognition and elimination,\nand immune memory formation, ultimately capitalizing on their distinctive\nattributes to enhance the effectiveness of the treatment [4].\n\nTMOs consist of oxygen atoms and transition metals, exhibiting high electron\nmobility, extended ductility, and strong stability. These materials are\nextensively utilized in various biomedical applications due to their favorable\nelectrical, magnetic, and biocompatible properties, high specific surface\narea, good chemical and mechanical stability, unique structure, and\nbiodegradability [5,6,7,8]. In addition to enhancing the generation of\nreactive oxygen species (ROS) independently, TMOs can synergize with\nphotodynamic (PDT), photothermal (PTT), magnetic thermal (MHT), and\nsonodynamic (SDT) therapies to combine multiple treatments into a single\nplatform. This significantly boosts ROS production efficiency, thereby\nenhancing ICD and dendritic cell (DC) maturation, further enhancing tumor\nimmunogenicity and facilitating the initiation of the anti-tumor immunity\ncycle [9,10,11,12]. Moreover, TMOs possess unique properties such as improved\nelectron transfer kinetics, strong adsorption capacity, high sensitivity, and\nexcellent light absorption capabilities, making them ideal for doping into\nMXenes to enhance their optical properties for biomedical applications. This\nenhancement greatly improves the efficacy of PDT and PTT [5,8,13]. Notably,\nTMOs exhibit greater stability, require lower doses, offer enhanced efficacy,\nand have fewer side effects compared to metal ions [14]. TMO nanoparticles\n(NPs) offer advantages over free small molecule drugs as they can penetrate\ntumors via the activated transendothelial pathway. Leveraging the enhanced\npermeability and retention (EPR) effect (the altered permeability of tumor\nblood vessels and lymphatic drainage), TMO NPs can efficiently accumulate in\ntumor tissues [15].\n\n", "question": "What are the advantages of transition metal oxide nanoparticles?", "answer": "TMO nanoparticles offer advantages over free small molecule drugs as they can penetrate tumors via the activated transendothelial pathway.

The polyvalent state of the transition metal vanadium\nforwards its Fenton-like catalytic capacity, and many nanoplatforms based on\nvanadium have been reported [107,108,109,110,111]. A two-dimensional nanosheet\ncontaining VV has been synthesized, in which VV could produce \u00b7OH and trigger\napoptosis in human breast cancer cells [111]. In a study on a vanadium-based\nnanoplatform that synergizes ferroptosis-like therapy, it was found that under\nacidic conditions in tumor cells, vanadium oxides disassemble and release VV,\nVIV, and LND. The mixed valence of vanadium (VIV and VV) triggers ferroptosis\nby cyclically altering the valence of V, leading to the generation of \u00b7OH for\nlipid peroxide accumulation (VIV \u2192 VV) and the depletion of GSH for GPX4\ndeactivation (VV \u2192 VIV). This process ultimately initiates ICD in tumor cells,\nactivates CTLs, and inhibits B16F10 tumor growth and metastasis while\nenhancing immune memory [112] (Figure 10).\n\n3\\. Conclusions and Future Perspectives\n\nThis paper provides an overview of the roles of TMOs in enhancing tumor\nimmunogenicity and reversing the immune-suppressive TME, ultimately leading to\nthe promotion of anti-tumor immune responses and improvement of immunotherapy\nefficacy. However, this field still faces many opportunities and challenges.\nTo further promote the development and clinical translation of TMO-based tumor\nimmunotherapy, efforts can be made in various aspects such as material\npreparation and modification, mechanism exploration, and the evaluation of\nbiological properties.\n\nFirst, the development of simple, practical, and reproducible synthetic\nmethods is crucial for promoting the biological application of TMO\nnanomaterials. The biocompatibility of nanomaterials is crucial for their\nclinical translation [22,57]. Recently developed biomimetic mineralization\nstrategies have been able to obtain TMO nanomaterials with good\nbiocompatibility, making them the preferred choice for preparing manganese-\nbased nanomaterials. Additionally, the surface modification of nanomaterials\nhas a significant impact on their behavior in vivo. Therefore, the development\nof new strategies to finely modify the surface properties of TMO nanomaterials\ncan significantly increase their accumulation at lesion sites and improve\ntheir therapeutic effects.

In addition, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors with\nenalapril preserve cardiac morphology and function [52].\n\nThe results of trials investigating the cardioprotective effect of aldosterone\nantagonists have yielded divergent outcomes. While eplerenone demonstrated no\ncardioprotective effect in the chronic AIC mouse model [52], it did exhibit a\nrestraining effect on doxorubicin in a second AIC mouse model [53].

A generalized example of this type of linker is presented in Figure 3 [31,33]. A relevant example for this type of linkers is R96-Dox in which the active cytotoxic doxorubicin (DOX) molecule is conjugated with an acid-sensitive linker, which blocks DNA replication, a hydrazone linker (6-maleimidocaproyl) linked to the cysteine (Cys) residues of the antibody humanized monoclonal BR96 (Figure 4) [26]. Sometimes this type of linker can be characterized by instability under physiological conditions, which limits its usefulness [34]. For example, regarding the inotuzumab ozogamicin product approved in 2017, in vivo hydrolysis of hydrazone has been shown to occur at a rate of 1.5\u20132% per day over 4 days. This ADC with the active metabolite calicheamycin contains a recombinant humanized anti-CD22 antibody, linked to N-acetyl-\u03b3-calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide through the acid-labile hydrazone linker (4-(4\u2032-acetylphenoxy)butanoic acid) [26]. Reduction-Sensitive Linkers Reduction-sensitive linkers include a disulfide bond that is susceptible to reduction by glutathione, exploiting the elevated intracellular glutathione levels present in cancer cells [23]. Also, they represent an alternative to the more unstable hydrazone linker under physiological conditions. The disulfide bond is encapsulated within the linker, resisting reductive cleavage in the blood flow [35]. Optimization of the steric obstacle of disulfide bridges may decrease premature drug release [11]. The main premise for cleavable ADCs with these linkers is the difference in the reduction potential within the intracellular environment. Glutathione, which is highly expressed and released during cell replication, is present in significant concentrations in cancer cells. Reducible linkers produce a neutral payload that is able to diffuse into adjacent cancer cells, and thus the bystander effect occurs [26]. Cantuzumab ravtansine (huC242-SPDB-DM4) has a disulfide linker ADC featuring a disulfide linker, a tubulin-targeting huC242 antibody, and an active cytotoxic molecule (Figure 5). In this process, the ADC undergoes proteolytic cleavage, followed by the breakdown of the disulfide bond to release the active drug, which is then enzymatically metabolized by S-methyltransferase [26]. Thus, both the structure and release mode of the cytotoxic active molecule are presented [35,36,37]. In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to assess the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of trastuzumab\u2013maytansinoid conjugates (microtubule depolymerizing agents) employing both disulfide and thioether linkers. It was thus demonstrated that the non-reducible thioether bond showed enhanced activity in comparison to unconjugated trastuzumab or trastuzumab bound to other maytansinoids by disulfide linkers [38].

Notably, SARS-CoV-2\npredominantly induces apoptosis in respiratory epithelial cells rather than\nnecrosis. This preference is evidenced by the abundance of apoptotic cells and\nscarcity of necrotic cells following invasion of human respiratory epithelial\ncells [47]. This characteristic may reflect the virus\u2019s \u201ccleverness\u201d in\nadopting immune \u201csilencing\u201d apoptosis as a survival strategy given that\napoptosis is more suitable for the virus\u2019s survival than necrosis, which can\ntrigger excessive production of inflammatory factors. Following SARS-CoV-2\ninfection, the virus persists longer in the nasal mucosa compared to the\nlungs, with lower production of inflammatory factors [48]. This is due to\nnasal mucosal epithelial cells primarily undergoing apoptosis after viral\ninfection, whereas in the lungs, the apoptosis rate is lower and the\npyroptosis rate is higher [48], while apoptosis of immune silence is more\nconducive to viral replication. Notably, the virus is predominantly present in\nsuperficial epithelial cells in the early stages of infection, and gradually\ninvades submucosal cells as the disease progresses [48]. Therefore, apoptosis\nmay favor the spread of the virus from nasal mucosal epithelial cells to\nsubmucosal cells, that is, apoptosis can promote the spread of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nMoreover, evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 triggers apoptosis in lung\nepithelial cells, destroys the alveolar capillary barrier, thereby promoting\nthe development of pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome\n(ARDS), and aggravating lung injury in patients with COVID-19, resulting in\nhigh mortality [35, 49\u201352]. Patients with severe COVID-19 were more likely to\ndevelop apoptosis than those with mild symptoms, highlighting the direct\nrelationship between apoptosis levels and severity and mortality of COVID-19\npatients [53]. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, the apoptosis ratio of B\nlymphocytes, T lymphocytes [54, 55] and monocytes [53] is also elevated. This\ncoupled with impaired phagocytosis and anti-inflammatory function of\nmacrophages and monocytes after phagocytosing apoptosis cells [56],\nparticularly in severe clinical cases, suggests that enhanced apoptosis of\nimmune cells may contribute to the severe clinical symptoms of COVID-19\npatients. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2-induced apoptosis in \u03b2 pancreatic cells\ncontributes to abnormal glucose metabolism, which aggravates diabetes [57]. In\nsummary, apoptosis aggravates multiple organ failure and microcirculation\ndisorders through various mechanisms, leading to higher patient mortality\nrates and poor clinical outcomes.\n\nMERS-CoV activates both endogenous and exogenous apoptotic pathways, leading\nto extensive apoptosis of bronchial epithelial cells, renal cells,\nmacrophages, dendritic cells and other cells, resulting in high morbidity and\nmortality among MERS patients [58\u201360].

Aloe-emodin mechanisms for anticancer activity consist of the inhibition of cell growth and proliferation, cell cycle arrest, initiation of apoptosis, and antimetastasic and antiangiogenic effects [311,316]. Specifically, studies evidenced, among other things, the suppression of cancer, by targeting the mTOR complex 2, as demonstrated in prostate cancer cells [317]; through the p53-dependent and p21-dependent apoptotic pathway in human hepatoma cell lines [318]; by the inhibition of AKT and ERK phosphorylation in TE1 esophageal cancer cells [319]; and by the inhibition of the ERK/MSK1 and AKT/GSK3\u03b2 signaling pathways in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced neoplastic cell transformation by inhibiting the ERK/MSK1 and AKT/GSK3\u03b2 signaling pathways [320]. A possible mechanism of the anticancer mechanism of aloe-emodin has been recently underlined by Meng et al. (2022) [321] through the inhibition of CYP1B1 enzyme. Su et al. (2023) [322] studied the anti-inflammatory properties of aloe-emodin, demonstrating its interesting activity in ameliorating cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis in vivo, in specific pathogen-free male and female C57BL/6 mice. Furkan et al. (2017) [323] demonstrated that aloe-emodin acts as an inhibitor of hemoglobin aggregation in vitro; thus, it is potentially useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s. The antiviral activity of aloe-emodin has been related to its interaction with galectin-3, a beta-galactoside-binding lectin, involved in viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2 [324]. The treatment with aloe-emodin was reported to upregulate Gal-3 expression in infected cells, leading to an increased expression of antiviral genes such as IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, protein kinase R (PKR), and 2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Galectin-3 inhibited influenza A virus replication, as well [325]. Zeng et al. (2019) [326] studied the inhibitory effect of aloe-emodin on tyrosinase activity by spectroscopic and molecular docking techniques. It was suggested that aloe-emodin spontaneously binds tyrosinase at one binding site in the hydrophobic cavity. Ma et al. (2020) [327] suggested the use of aloe-emodin as a natural effective photosensitizer in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy against oral infections of drug-resistant C. albicans. Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that aloe-emodin has a poor intestinal absorption, short elimination half-life, and low bioavailability.

{"context": "Blocking intracellular resistance pathways to overcome TKI resistanceAutophagy\n\nAutophagy is a catabolic degradation process of cells under internal or\nexternal stress and has been proposed as a cell death mechanism, called\nprogrammed cell death type II [61, 62]. Autophagy is the process of\ntransferring cytoplasmic macromolecules, aggregated proteins, damaged\norganelles or pathogens to lysosomes, which are then digested and decomposed\ninto nucleotides, amino acids, fatty acids, sugars and ATP, and finally\nrecycling [63\u201365]. The role of autophagy in cancer is complex, including tumor\noccurrence, development, and maintenance of malignancy [63]. Oxidative stress\nis a major trigger of autophagy, with ROS participating in signal transduction\nin autophagic cells [66]. Autophagy plays different roles in TKI treatment,\nincluding toxic autophagy-mediated cell death and protective autophagy-\nmediated TKI resistance.\n\nAutophagy has been frequently observed in tumor treatment with TKIs, such as\nafatinib for head and neck cancer [67], osimertinib for lung cancer [68],\nlenvatinib for liver cancer [69], and erlotinib for head and neck cancer [17].\nAutophagy-dependent cell death is usually accompanied by an increase in\nautophagy markers and the accumulation of autophagosomes [70]. Lapatinib, in\ncombination with the BCL-2 family inhibitor obatoclax (GX15-070), kills\nresistant breast cancer cells through mTOR inhibition and P38MAPK activation,\nresulting in ROS production, ER stress signal activation, and stimulation of\ntoxic autophagy [71, 72]. When lenvatinib is administered alongside the\nhistone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor entinostat, it activates ATM and the\nelongation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1) via ROS. This activation increases\nBeclin1 and autophagy-related 5 expression, resulting in the enhanced\nformation of toxic autophagosomes and reduced expression of protective\nmitochondrial proteins in hepatoma cells [69]. Similarly, crizotinib markedly\nelevates ROS levels to promote autophagy activation and pyroptosis, mediating\nhepatotoxicity during the therapy process [73]. In addition, autophagy caused\nby TKIs can also induce ferroptosis of killer cells. For example, neratinib\nincreases ROS and Fe2+ activities and downregulates GPX4, leading to\nferroptosis of AML cells [31, 74].\n\nUnlike toxic autophagy, ROS-induced protective autophagy mediates the\ninsensitivity of cancer cells to TKIs. Afatinib inhibits mTOR through the\nROS/DNA damage responses 1/tuberous sclerosis 1 (ROS/REDD1/TSC1) axis,\nstimulates protective autophagy in HNSCC cells, and diminishes their\nsusceptibility to cell death [67]. In lung cancer cells, the accumulation of\nROS caused by afatinib treatment led to the downregulation of AKT/mTOR signal\ntransduction and produces protective autophagy; however, the combination of\nautophagy inhibitors enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of afatinib [29].\nVandetanib, a multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor, induces protective\nautophagy and leads to chemical resistance by increasing the levels of ROS in\nNSCLC cells [75].

The results were depicted in\nFigure 5D, ETS1 was found to be capable of binding to both E1 and E2 sites.\nThe enrichment was enhanced by the overexpression of ETS1 and dramatically\ndecreased by the knockdown of ETS1. Promoter dual luciferase reporter assay\nwas performed in HEK293 and Cal27 cells to confirm whether ETS1\ntranscriptionally activates the SOAT1 promoter. Wild type and corresponding\nmutants were constructed (Figure 5E). We found that the overexpression of ETS1\nupregulated the luciferase activity of the reporter gene, whereas mutations in\nboth binding sites partially reduced the elevated luciferase activity,\nconfirming the specificity of the effect (Figure 5F). Furthermore, the\nmutation at the E2 site suppressed the elevation of luciferase activity to a\ngreater extent compared to Mut1, suggesting that ETS1 had a superior\nenrichment at the E2 site. These results demonstrate that ETS1 acts as a\ntranscription factor that positively regulates the transcriptional level of\nSOAT1 mainly by binding to the E2 site.\n\nAfterwards, additional experiments were conducted to confirm the regulatory\neffect of ETS1 on SOAT1 expression.

{"context": "INTRODUCTION\n\nAlthough blood transfusion is life-saving in various clinical scenarios,\npatients are at risk of developing significant post-transfusion complications\n[1, 2]. Despite reassuring evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs),\nnew literature is constantly emerging regarding potential clinical sequelae\n(other than mortality) from blood transfusions [3\u20135]. There are potential\netiological links between storage lesions and adverse outcomes following\ntransfusion. Retrospective observational studies have revealed that\ntransfusion of long-term-stored blood leads to poor clinical results including\na higher incidence rate of multiple organ failure, nosocomial infection, and\nmortality [5\u20137]. These unfavorable outcomes are thought to be partly due to\nthe immunosuppressive effects of blood transfusion. In long-term-stored blood,\ncytokines and inflammatory cellular components are released into the plasma,\nresulting in gradual biochemical and morphological changes [8]. Cytokine\nproduction can occur in whole blood samples within 2 h of blood collection\n[9]. Extending the duration of storage can result in significant increase in\nthe release of inflammatory cellular components [8, 10, 11]. The RBCs used for\ntransfusion are refrigerated in a preservation solution, thus prolonging their\nshelf life. The duration of storage is dependent on how they are collected.\nThe longest is 42 days for example in the US, but some products have shorter\nstorage durations in different jurisdictions [12]. The RBCs undergo many\nphysical and chemical changes during cold storage. These changes, collectively\nreferred to as RBC storage lesions, affect the quality and function of the\nRBCs, diminishing the in vivo survival of transfused RBCs.\n\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small non-coding RNAs (approximately 19-22\nnucleotides), regulate post-transcriptional gene expression by inhibiting\ntranslation or inducing target-specific messenger RNA (mRNA) [13]. These\nmiRNAs participate in various physiological and pathophysiological processes,\nincluding immunity, cancer cell proliferation, and drug resistance [14]. Each\nmiRNA targets multiple mRNAs, either alone or in combination with other\nmiRNAs, thus miRNAs can regulate complex gene expression regulatory networks\n[15]. In blood, miRNAs, are commonly referred to as circulating miRNAs. Some\nstudies suggested a relationship between miRNAs and the physiological state of\nthe RBCs [16, 17]. Therefore, RBC miRNAs are considered appropriate surrogates\nfor RBC storage lesions. The miRNAs could be potential predictors, indicating\nthe safety and efficacy of blood products [18]. miR-33a-5p plays a crucial\nrole in regulating cholesterol and lipid metabolism and is associated with\ntheir host genes, and the bioinformatics website further validated the\nmiR-33a-5p targeting fork box K2 (FOXK2) and participated in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR\nsignaling pathway through in vitro experiments [19, 20]. In addition, the\nexpression level of miR-33a-5p in the circulation is disordered in diabetes\npatients and pre-diabetes patients, indicating that miRNA has potential\ndiagnostic use\n\n", "question": "What are the potential predictors for the safety and efficacy of blood products?", "answer": "RBC miRNAs, such as miR-33a-5p, are considered appropriate surrogates for RBC storage lesions and could be potential predictors, indicating the safety and efficacy of blood products."}

For example, CD169+ subcapsular sinus macrophages\npresent lipids derived from particulate antigens to iNKT cells in the\nparacortex (101). Thymic macrophages play essential roles in activating and\nshaping effector functions of thymic iNKT cells (102), demonstrated by the\ndecrease in NKT2 abundance and IL-4 production upon deficiency of thymic\nF4/80+ Mertk + macrophages or abrogation of CD1d expression in thymic CD11c +\ncells (103). In the intestine, macrophages derived from murine embryonic and\nnon-bone marrow sources influence the local establishment of iNKT cells in the\ncolon during early life, impacting susceptibility or resistance to iNKT cell-\nassociated mucosal disorders in later stages (104).\n\nOn the flip side, activated iNKT cells exert regulatory control over\nmacrophages. In the lean state, iNKT cells aid in dampening adipose\ninflammation by polarizing macrophages towards an M2 phenotype, a regulatory\nfunction impaired in obesity (105, 106). Moreover, iNKT cells modulate tumor\ngrowth, partly by altering the phenotype of tumor-associated macrophages, a\ncell population crucial for the growth of certain neoplasms (107, 108). This\nbidirectional crosstalk between iNKT cells and macrophages underscores their\nintricate regulatory roles in immune responses, inflammation, and disease\nprogression.\n\n5.3Interactions with B cells\n\niNKT cells play a crucial role in regulating B cell functions through cytokine\nrelease and CD40 ligand signaling (102, 109). Notably, all B cells express\nCD1d, with marginal zone B cells (MZBs) in both mice and humans showing\nparticularly high CD1d expression (110). B cells can present foreign or self-\nlipids on CD1d following B cell receptor-mediated uptake. iNKT cells offer\ncognate B cell help when their stimulatory lipid antigen is linked to a\nspecific B cell epitope (111). This interaction facilitates the\ninternalization of the antigen complex, enabling the presentation of the\nstimulatory lipid by CD1d on the same B cell. Additionally, in an inflammatory\nenvironment, iNKT cells can provide non-cognate B cell help (112). For\ninstance, co-administration of \u03b1GalCer with a protein antigen allows iNKT\ncells to recognize lipids separately from B cell antigen recognition, ensuring\nefficient B cell help.\n\nMoreover, iNKT cells contribute to protection against autoimmunity by\nsupporting regulatory B cell (Breg) responses. Activation of iNKT cells by\n\u03b1GalCer expands innate IL-10 producing MZBs, which suppress autoimmunity\nthrough IL-10 secretion (113, 114). In a reciprocal manner, Bregs induce iNKT\ncells to produce IFN\u03b3 and modulate cytokine production, reducing Th1 and Th17\nresponses and consequently ameliorating experimental arthritis (115). The\nessential role of B cell presentation in iNKT cell regulatory responses is\nhighlighted by studies in mice lacking CD1d on B cells, which exhibited\nexacerbated arthritis, emphasizing the contribution of activated B cells in\nengaging the iNKT regulatory pathway. Human studies corroborate these\nfindings, underscoring the clinical relevance of these regulatory interactions\n(116).\n\n5.4Interactions with\n\n", "question": "What is the relationship between iNKT cells and macrophages?", "answer": "iNKT cells exert regulatory control over macrophages.

ZVI-NPs transformed protumor M2\nmacrophages into antitumor M1 macrophages, reduced the population of\nregulatory T cells, and downregulated PD-1 and CTLA4 in CD8+ T cells to boost\ntheir cancer cell cytolytic activity. Notably, they also managed to curtail\nPD-L1 expression in cancer cells (Hsieh et al., 2021).\n\nSimilarly, in 2023, Zhou et al., in 2023, worked with FeGd-HN@Sorafenib@TGF-\u03b2-\nantibody@RGD2 NPs (FG-STR NPs) to treat MC38 tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice.\nTreatment results in the infiltration of various immune cells, including\nmemory B cells, eosinophils, lymphoid cells, mast cells, NK cells, monocytes,\nM1 macrophages, and CD8+ T cells, into the tumor microenvironment. This led to\nthe production of IFN-\u03b3+, provoking antitumor cytotoxicity. Moreover,\nincreased expression of markers such as CD11c+, CD80+, and MHC-II + confirmed\nthe maturation of DCs (Zhou et al., 2023c).\n\nBuilding on these findings, specific components can be integrated into the\nnanosystems to further augment immune cell activation. A key example includes\nthe indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitors (e.g., NLG919), which are\nused in the creation of FPBC@SN nanoparticles, as detailed in the work of Zuo\net al. This is particularly relevant because an increase in IDO expression can\nincrease tryptophan degradation, which is crucial for T cell activation and\nproliferation (Zuo et al., 2021).\n\nAnother intricate nanoformulation is CP nanoparticles, which are composed of\nCBD nanoparticles and poly (I:C). As illustrated by Kim et al., these\nnanoparticles not only inhibit the increase in PD-L1 expression on tumor cells\nbut also enhance tumor sensitivity to T-cell-mediated destruction. This\nprevents tumor escape from immunosurveillance, thereby improving the overall\nefficacy of immunotherapy (Yang Qunfang et al., 2023).\n\n8 Nanoparticles that induce ferroptosis and other types of cell death\n(apoptosis, autophagy and cuproptosis)8.1 Nanoparticles as dual agents for\ninducing ferroptosis and apoptosis\n\nThe potential of nanoparticles to promote ferroptosis, has led to promising\ndevelopments in cancer therapeutics. However, these findings have shed light\non an even more intriguing capability: their role in concurrently inducing\napoptosis in cancer cells. This dual function serves as a multifaceted attack\non cancer cells, opening up the possibility of exploiting multiple cell death\npathways for a more comprehensive therapeutic strategy (Zhong et al., 2023).\n\nThe common denominator in both ferroptosis and apoptosis induction is the\ngeneration of reactive oxygen species (ROS). NPs prompt ROS production,\nleading to lipid peroxidation, a critical factor in initiating both\nferroptosis and apoptosis. The products of lipid peroxidation interact with\nmembrane receptors, transcription factors, or inhibitors, triggering apoptosis\nsignaling. In parallel, ROS can breach the mitochondrial membrane integrity,\nreleasing cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, an event that initiates caspase\nthree activation and thus initiates apoptosis (Su et al., 2019; Wang Yaxuan et\nal., 2023).\n\nThis interplay between ferroptosis and apoptosis induced by nanoparticles has\nbeen highlighted in numerous studies. For instance, Yuan et al.'s work with\nCuCP Lipo nanoparticles demonstrated their dual ability to induce ferroptosis\nand apoptosis in cancer cells. The nanoparticles initiated lipid peroxidation\nand triggered the upregulation of the p53 protein, a well-known regulator of\ncell cycle arrest,\n\n", "question": "How do nanoparticles induce ferroptosis and apoptosis in cancer cells?", "answer": "Nanoparticles can prompt ROS production, leading to lipid peroxidation, a critical factor in initiating both ferroptosis and apoptosis.

The availability of an ALK inhibitor, crizotinib,\nfacilitated immediate clinical studies on ALK-rearranged LCs, which were\nhighly successful and quickly led to the approval of this drug [83]. There are\nseveral more modern ALK inhibitors, which are characterized by increased\npotency and good penetration into the brain. Alectinib and lorlatinib produced\nparticularly impressive PFS estimates while given as first-line medication,\nwith median OS not reached in both of these studies [24, 25, 84]. The\nprolonged survival of patients with ALK-rearranged LC signifies the emphasis\non the quality of life of the treated patients, as many of them continue to\nwork and manage regular social activities [12]. ALK rearrangements are\nparticularly common in LC female patients aged below 40 years, and there are\nseveral reports describing childbirth during the treatment of ALK-driven LC\n[85].\n\nSignificant efforts have been invested in the development of methods for ALK\ntranslocation detection. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was\ninitially considered a \u201cgold standard\u201d, however, its utilization is\ncomplicated due to relatively high costs. Several antibodies for\nimmunohistochemical (IHC) ALK detection produce acceptable balance between\nsensitivity and specificity, so they are permitted as a stand-alone test for\nALK diagnostics [69, 86]. Still, there is a critical mass of evidence\nsuggesting that \u201cmorphological\u201d methods of ALK analysis are not sufficiently\nreliable and need to be replaced by the direct detection of translocations.\nClinical studies demonstrate better outcomes in patients with ALK\ntranslocations confirmed by two independent methods as compared to subjects\nwhose tumor was analyzed by a single IHC or FISH test [87, 88]. Furthermore,\nFISH and IHC are unable to detect translocation variants; this is a serious\ndisadvantage at least for clinical studies, given that the identity of the\ntranslocation partner may influence outcomes of ALK-targeted therapy [89].\nIndeed, some preclinical and clinical investigations revealed that so-called\n\u201cshort\u201d ALK fusion variants (particularly, v.3 and v.5) are less sensitive to\nALK inhibitors than the \u201clong\u201d fusion versions (v.1, v.2, etc.). In addition,\nALK rearrangement variants may differ in their ability to acquire TKI-\nresistance via secondary mutation [90]. RNA sequencing is believed to be the\nbest method for the analysis of actionable gene rearrangements, although it\nhas not been subjected yet to rigorous multicenter validation studies [5, 86].\nWhile discussing the advantages and disadvantages of PCR analysis, most\nrelevant papers consider the so-called variant-specific PCR, i.e., the assays\nwhich are capable of detecting common translocations included in the\ncorresponding kit or laboratory protocol [69, 86].

Additionally, their classification as P-glycoprotein substrates and the predictions of limited gastrointestinal absorption emphasize the need for optimization to ensure efficient delivery and therapeutic efficacy. The MTT assay provides a clear understanding of the cytotoxic effects of Rutin and Naringin, revealing their potential as effective cancer treatments. The concentration-dependent cytotoxicity observed in these experiments highlights a crucial characteristic of these natural compounds: their ability to specifically target cancer cells while having minimal impact on normal cells. The selectivity of the compounds is evident in their capacity to maintain cell viability within the range of 50\u201395% in normal cells, even when exposed to concentrations ranging from 0\u2013160 \u00b5M. In contrast, increasing concentrations of the compounds have been found to cause greater toxicity in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. These findings suggest that these chemicals have a wider range of effectiveness in treating cancer, indicating their potential for safer treatment methods. The pronounced cytotoxicity observed in cancer cells, in contrast to the minimal effect on normal cells, is consistent with previous research that highlights the specific targeting of plant-derived chemicals against malignant tissues. The research conducted by Alshwyeh et al.40 and Nahar et al.41 supports the idea that natural chemicals can specifically target cancer cells while sparing normal cells. This characteristic reduces the potential harm to healthy cells, making these compounds promising candidates for anticancer treatments. This is further supported by the comparison analysis with Anastrozole, highlighting the effectiveness of Rutin and Naringin in a therapeutic environment. Furthermore, the fact that no harmful effects were observed in healthy cells even at doses as high as 160 \u00b5M for both Rutin and Naringin sets an important standard for safety. This implies that these chemicals have the potential to be used in therapeutic applications without causing harm to healthy tissue. This is supported by the ability of Rutin to induce apoptosis in gastric cancer cells, as demonstrated by Li et al.42. The features of Rutin and Naringin highlight their usefulness not only as anticancer agents but also as compounds that have a positive safety profile43. The distinct cytotoxic effects of Rutin and Naringin on malignant and non-cancerous cell lines highlight the need for further research to uncover the underlying mechanisms of action. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of these processes is crucial for the advancement of innovative cancer treatments that leverage the specific ability of natural substances to target cancer cells, intending to develop techniques that are both highly effective and free from the harmful side effects commonly associated with traditional chemotherapy. The findings related to Rutin and Naringin underscore the promise of natural compounds in enhancing cancer therapy towards more tailored and less harmful methods by preferentially targeting cancer cells. The DPPH assay findings demonstrate a good antioxidant activity that varies with the quantity of Rutin and Naringin, in contrast to the steady activity reported for Quercetin. The observed trend indicates a subtle behavior of natural antioxidants, where Rutin and Naringin have a strong ability to neutralize free radicals at lower concentrations, but this ability decreases as the dosages increase.

However, its precise role(s) in mediating the epigenetic switch\nthat contributes to the dysregulated gene signature during disease\npathogenesis is poorly characterised.

Notably, we reveal an unreported mechanism\nunderscoring TWEAK/Fn14-induced rewiring of the TNBC epigenome, contributing\nto the dysregulated expression of NAMPT critical for metastasis.\n\nExtensive research has characterised the pivotal role of epigenetic\naberrations, particularly oncogenic SE activation, in regulating the\ntranscriptome of various cancers including BC52, medulloblastoma66, colorectal\ncancer67,68 and multiple myeloma69. This often leads to dysregulated oncogenic\ntranscription, promoting tumorigenesis, metastasis and metabolic\nreprogramming. Collectively, these studies demonstrate the critical role of\nSE-driven transcriptional dependencies in cancer malignancy and highlight\npotential vulnerabilities that can be exploited for therapeutic targeting.\nIntriguingly, our findings show that TWEAK/Fn14-activated oncogenic SEs\npromote aberrant gene expression programmes in TNBC through chromatin looping.\nIn particular, we identified a TWEAK/Fn14-driven, TNBC-specific SE that is\ncrucial for activating NAMPT expression.

Meanwhile, METTL3 emerged as an independent risk\nfactor for the prognosis of HNSCC patients. Moreover, METTL3 overexpression\npromoted HNSCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis,\nwhile the knockdown of METTL3 had the opposite effect in vivo and in vitro.\nMechanistically, METTL3 enhanced the m6A modification of CDC25B mRNA, thereby\nstabilizing it and upregulating its expression, consequently activating the\nG2/M phase of the cell cycle and driving HNSCC malignant progression (19).\nAlso, in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), METTL3 was significantly\nupregulated in tissue samples and correlated with the poor prognosis of OSCC\npatients.

{"context": "Introduction\n\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) antibodies that block the PD-1 or CTLA-4 pathway have revolutionized cancer therapy. By preventing signals that turn \u201coff\u201d killing functions of T cells, ICIs can unleash host immunity against cancer cells, producing remarkable survival advantages and even cures for a minority of patients. Unfortunately, most patients do not benefit from ICIs, and some patients experience severe side effects of these drugs. Extending ICIs to breast cancer and other, less immunogenic tumors remains a substantial barrier in cancer immunotherapy. Recently, the anti\u2013PD-1 ICI pembrolizumab received approval for treatment of high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in July, 2021 (1). TNBC tumors, the least common and most aggressive subtype, typically show more inflammation than other subtypes of breast cancer. An inflamed, immune \u201chot\u201d environment correlates with better outcomes in TNBC (2). Unfortunately, most patients with TNBC do not benefit from immunotherapy based on current metrics for selection and/or do not respond to ICIs (3). For example, in the KEYNOTE-355 trial, pembrolizumab significantly extended survival in patients categorized as favorable for immunotherapy based on high expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages in biopsy samples (4). Despite improved overall survival, anti\u2013PD-1 treatment allowed only 11% more patients to survive through the 4.5-year study endpoint relative to those treated only with chemotherapy. These data highlight shortcomings of existing criteria to evaluate patients likely to respond to immunotherapy and assess effects of treatment in breast cancer. Creating new, optimally noninvasive methods to assess immunotherapy in patients with TNBC and identify early effects of therapy on T cells will help optimize use of existing drugs and facilitate translation of new immunotherapies. Since only a minority of patients across all malignancies respond to current ICIs, better methods to select patients and monitor therapy likely will improve outcomes across multiple cancers.\n\nActivated T cells are one of the hallmarks of an inflamed, effective antitumor immune response. Previous studies suggest a link between activation of T cells and cholesterol. T cells increase cholesterol through de novo synthesis from acetyl CoA or uptake from lipoproteins through receptor-mediated endocytosis of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles from the bloodstream. Cholesterol is an essential component of cellular membranes, where this lipid modulates membrane fluidity, permeability, and receptor-mediated signaling (5). Upon activation, T cell receptor (TCR) nanoclusters form in cholesterol-rich membrane domains to elicit strong TCR signaling (6). Proliferating T cells and other cell types require increased amounts of cholesterol to replicate cell membranes, utilizing cholesterol stored as cholesterol esters in intracellular lipid droplets. Despite requirements for cholesterol in T cell activation and proliferation, increased cholesterol uptake by tumor-infiltrating T cells also has been linked to an exhausted T cell phenotype (7). However, exhausted T cells indicate a history of active T cell populations, and both populations of T cells correlate with success of ICIs in TNBC (8, 9). Therefore, cholesterol uptake by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) could indicate a hot tumor environment and determine the efficacy of immunotherapy.\n\nOur research group previously developed the fluorinated radiotracer, eFNP-59, as an analog for cholesterol that can be leveraged to", "question": "What is the purpose of using pembrolizumab in breast cancer treatment?", "answer": "Pembrolizumab is used to treat high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and has been shown to extend survival in patients with high expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages."}

Early\ndetection not only improves treatment outcomes, but also has a positive impact\non the psychological, economic, and social complications of this disease [21].\nTherefore, there is a significant focus on finding minimally invasive, cost-\neffective diagnostic biomarkers for BC. This research aims to identify and\ninvestigate their utility for diagnosing and prognosing different cancers,\nincluding BC [22]. Several miRNAs have appeared in the plasma or serum of\npatients with BC. MiRNAs profiling studies can categorize dysregulated miRNAs\nand group BC patients for treatments, this may demonstrate the potential of\nmiRNA as a prognostic and therapeutic biomarker [23].\n\nIn BC patients, miR-122 has been identified as a tumour suppressor that\ntargets the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor [24]. A previous study\nshowed that miR-122 acts as a tumour suppressor by regulating oncogenes such\nas cyclin G1, AKT3, and CDK4 in hepatocellular carcinoma [25]. Downregulation\nof miR-122 has been observed in hepatocellular carcinoma [26].\n\nOn the other hand, higher levels of circulatory miR-122 correlate with\nhepatocellular carcinoma [27] and liver injury [28].

The\nphysiological role of miR-122 differs according to the type of cancer [19].\nOur study demonstrated a significantly higher expression of serum miRNA122 in\nBC patients compared to age-matched patients with benign breast lesions and\nhealthy controls. To find a possible relationship between miRNA 122 and the\nclinicopathological features of BC patients, we did not find any association\nbetween miR-122 and any of these features. However, a study by Wu et al. found\nthat higher levels of miR-122 were associated with HER2-negative and non-\ninflammatory tumours [31].

{"context": "1\\. Introduction\n\nBreast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent malignancy worldwide (11.7% of all\ncancer cases in 2020), and it is acknowledged as one of the leading causes of\ncancer-related mortality (6.9% of all cancer-related deaths in 2020),\naccording to GLOBOCAN reports [1]. Traditional predictors such as tumoral and\npathological properties are well-established in BC but could not classify the\npatients comprehensively regarding intra- and inter-patient heterogeneity.\nTherefore, developing more reliable and precise predictors could facilitate\ncategorizing patients into subtypes with distinct characterizations [2, 3].\nMolecular biomarker profiling of BC, determined by gene expression\nexperiments, could classify patients into different subtypes based on\ndifferent expression levels of these biomarkers in each subtype [4]. This\nclassification revealed that BC subtypes have distinct diagnostic,\ntherapeutic, and prognostic features that can significantly aid escalation/de-\nescalation options. Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and Ki67 are the main molecular\nbiomarkers in patients of BC [5]. Evidence has shown that hormone receptors\nsuch as ER and PR are associated with a good prognosis, and PR/ER-negative\npatients have a poorer prognosis [6]. Patients with positive HER2, a\ntransmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, have been shown to have a poorer\nprognosis and more aggressive features of the tumor [7]. Also, Ki67, as an\nexpressed antigen in cell cycle phases, has a positive correlation with tumor\naggressiveness and proliferative activity, hence poorer prognosis and\nrecurrence in patients of BC [8]. ER, PR, HER2, and Ki67 are evaluated mainly\nby immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis after biopsy or surgically excised\nsamples. However, this method is not only an invasive and time-consuming\nprocedure, but a single local tumor specimen only sometimes captures the\nstatus of these biomarkers in the whole tumor. Therefore, it is urgently\nneeded to establish a non-invasive, easy-to-do, and more representative method\n[9]. Current limitations of molecular paradigms to classify BC patients could\nbe overcome by the new era of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. There\nare different AI methods, of which AI-powered radiomics and deep learning are\nthe two main approaches. The AI-powered Radiomics method is an umbrella term\nfor the extraction of quantitative and reproducible information from medical\nimages such as ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT) scan, and\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to develop decision support models\nrecognizing complex patterns of images that are not visible by human naked\neyes [10]. On the other hand, deep learning (DL), as a convolutional neural\nnetwork-based algorithm, can also assist clinical decision-making by self-\neducation of complex patterns of diagnostic images, bypassing the manual\nextraction of imaging features [11].\n\nTherefore, developing a non-invasive AI-based decision-making system using\nroutine imaging modalities (US, CT, or MRI) before any invasive procedure is\nnecessary to predict the essential molecular biomarkers in BC tissue. Herein,\nwe searched databases and designed this systematic review and meta-analysis of\ncurrent data on the accuracy of AI-based methods for predicting\n\n", "question": "What is the main goal of developing a non-invasive AI-based decision-making system for breast cancer?", "answer": "To predict the essential molecular biomarkers in breast cancer tissue using routine imaging modalities before any invasive procedure."}
{"context": "ERK/MAPK inhibitors are nonetheless susceptible to evolved resistance in a manner suggestive of transcriptional bypass programs12\u201315. Counter to earlier models, we found that transcriptional reprogramming extends beyond the well-established early response, and instead represents a dynamic, evolved process as cell populations refine expression changes to attain a stably resistant phenotype. We delineate the previously hypothesized concept that the intrinsic early transcriptional response can be targeted as a \u201cbottleneck\u201d event and show how this period is broadly vulnerable to pharmacologic perturbation of chromatin-level events in order to block diverse, cell line-specific transcriptional resistance programs. Mechanistic and translational studies reveal that Mediator kinase inhibition antagonizes a conserved early response to ERK/MAPK inhibition, resulting in paralysis of the further transcriptional events necessary for stable resistance. These findings demonstrate that co-targeting of Mediator kinase represents a well-tolerated strategy for preventing resistance to sustained ERK/MAPK inhibition, and furthers our understanding of the kinetics and plasticity underlying drug response.", "question": "How does Mediator kinase inhibition affect resistance to ERK/MAPK inhibition?", "answer": "Mediator kinase inhibition antagonizes a conserved early response to ERK/MAPK inhibition, resulting in paralysis of the further transcriptional events necessary for stable resistance."}
