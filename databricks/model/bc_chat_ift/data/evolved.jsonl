The circadian proteins\nundergo post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation,\nacetylation, sumoylation, O-GlcNAcylation) modulating their activity and in\nsequence ubiquitination/proteasomal degradation allowing correct functioning\nof the TTFL and setting of biological clock speed [22\u201324]. An auxiliary\ninterconnected loop is operated by the nuclear receptors (NRs) REV-ERBs and\nretinoic acid-related (RAR) orphan receptor (RORs), which drive BMAL1 rhythmic\ntranscription competing for a ROR specific response elements (RORE) in its\npromoter [25]. ROR-\u03b1 works as transcription activator and physically interacts\nwith peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1\n(PGC-1\u03b1), which recruits chromatin-remodelling complexes to proximal BMAL1\npromoters and elicits BMAL1 transcription. Conversely, REV-ERB-\u03b1 interacts\nwith the nuclear corepressor/histone deacetylase3 (NCoR-HDAC3) corepressor\ncomplex and inhibits BMAL1 transcription [25]. Other than the NR operated\nfeedback loop, CLOCK: BMAL1 heterodimers through cognate D-box elements\nregulate the expression of the PAR domain basic leucine zipper (bZIP)\ntranscription factors and first order clock controlled gens DBP (albumin\nD-site binding protein), TEF (thyrotroph embryonic factor), HLF (hepatic\nleukaemia factor), which successively drive the rhythmic expression of\nthousands tissue specific (output) genes [26, 27]. Besides, REV-ERBs and DBP\ncompeting for Res drive the expression of the Nuclear factor, interleukin 3\nregulated protein (NFIL3, also known as E4BP4), whose promoter contains a\nRORE, so that its transcription is suppressed by REV-ERBs and shows an\noscillatory pattern with opposite phase respect to DBP [26, 27]. Other\ncircadian components involved in the molecular clockwork are the E-box-binding\nbasic helix-loop-helix transcription factors DEC1 (Differentially expressed in\nchondrocytes protein 1) and DEC2 [26, 27]. In particular, DEC1 transcription\nis elicited by CLOCK: BMAL1 heterodimer, but in turn DEC1 proteins repress\nCLOCK: BMAL1 transcriptional activity, operating a power steering\n\n", "question": "What drives circadian rhythmicity at the cellular level?", "answer": "A group of genes, named core clock genes, and their encoded proteins.", "prompt": "You can paraphrase the question and answer."}
