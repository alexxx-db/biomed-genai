The detection of these specific genetic markers can help distinguish ARMS from other subtypes of RMS. In cases where the tests for these fusion genes are not performed, the break-apart of the FOXO1 gene at locus 13q14 detected by FISH can further support the diagnosis of ARMS.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021). Alternol was isolated from the fermentation of a mutant fungus obtained from Taxus brevifolia bark (Liu et al., 2020).

The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5. Mitochondria are the key organelles involved in\nmetabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, and maintaining mitochondrial\nintegrity is the absolute basis of oxidative phosphorylation6. In addition,\nprevious studies have also indicated that the number, structure, and function\nof mitochondria often change in malignant tumor cells to meet the needs of\nrapid growth in acidic and anoxic environments7.\n\nAs a key regulatory subunit of mitochondrial integrity, mitochondrial inner\nmembrane protein (IMMT), also known as Mic-60 or Mitofilin8, is not only an\nimportant part of the mitochondrial contact sites and cristae organization\nsystem (MICOS) complex, but it also interacts with members of the SAM (The\nSorting and Assembly Machinery) complex to form the mitochondrial membrane\nspace bridging complex9. Recent studies have linked IMMT to the onset of\nvarious diseases, including cardiomyopathy10, degenerative encephalopathy11\nand kidney injury12. However, research on the significance of IMMT in cancers\nis rare, and the only literature proposed that IMMT expression might be\nrelated to cancer prognosis13,14. To date, few reports have been published on\nthe relationship between IMMT and the development and progression of BC, and\nthe functions of IMMT in BC remains largely undefined.\n\nThe purpose of this investigation was to delve into the potential functions\nand underlying biological processes of IMMT in the development and progression\nof BC. To achieve this objective, bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry\n(IHC) were utilized to determine the prognostic significance of IMMT and its\ncorrelation with clinicopathological parameters in BC patients. Furthermore,\nin vitro experiments were conducted to assess the impact of IMMT on the\nproliferation and apoptosis of BC cells, and the morphological and functional\nchanges of mitochondria after IMMT knockdown (KD) were also evaluated.\nAdditionally, functional enrichment analysis and\n\n", "question": "What is the potential function of IMMT in the development and progression of BC?", "answer": "IMMT may play a role in the development and progression of BC by regulating mitochondrial integrity and metabolic reprogramming.", "prompt": "Re-write the question to ask in greater depth.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021). Alternol was isolated from the fermentation of a mutant fungus obtained from Taxus brevifolia bark (Liu et al., 2020).

The use of bioidentical HRT products may be a safer option for women seeking to alleviate menopausal symptoms without increasing their risk of breast cancer.

The choice of fusion partner is influenced by the functional compatibility between the partner gene and the TK, and some partner genes, such as TPM3 and ETV6, use the same exons to generate oncogenic fusions with different TKs.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

By exploiting the high affinity of folate receptors for folic acid, drug delivery systems can be designed to selectively target and internalize within cancer cells, enhancing the efficacy of treatment and reducing side effects.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors.

This activation of Artemis is critical for it to gain various nuclease activities, including hairpin opening activity and endonuclease activity for end processing. Moreover, Artemis is indispensable for nucleotide loss from signal ends during the repair process, highlighting the importance of DNA-PKcs in facilitating these processes.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021). Alternol was isolated from the fermentation of a mutant fungus obtained from Taxus brevifolia bark (Liu et al., 2020).

The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5. Mitochondria are the key organelles involved in\nmetabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, and maintaining mitochondrial\nintegrity is the absolute basis of oxidative phosphorylation6. In addition,\nprevious studies have also indicated that the number, structure, and function\nof mitochondria often change in malignant tumor cells to meet the needs of\nrapid growth in acidic and anoxic environments7.\n\nAs a key regulatory subunit of mitochondrial integrity, mitochondrial inner\nmembrane protein (IMMT), also known as Mic-60 or Mitofilin8, is not only an\nimportant part of the mitochondrial contact sites and cristae organization\nsystem (MICOS) complex, but it also interacts with members of the SAM (The\nSorting and Assembly Machinery) complex to form the mitochondrial membrane\nspace bridging complex9.

The mortality of BC\npatients has been significantly reduced by radical surgery, radiotherapy,\nchemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy within the past decade,\nbut many patients still experience recurrence or metastasis, eventually\nleading to death2. The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5. Mitochondria are the key organelles involved in\nmetabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, and maintaining mitochondrial\nintegrity is the absolute basis of oxidative phosphorylation6. In addition,\nprevious studies have also indicated that the number, structure, and function\nof mitochondria often change in malignant tumor cells to meet the needs of\nrapid growth in acidic and anoxic environments7.\n\nAs a key regulatory subunit of mitochondrial integrity, mitochondrial inner\nmembrane protein (IMMT), also known as Mic-60 or Mitofilin8, is not only an\nimportant part of the mitochondrial contact sites and cristae organization\nsystem (MICOS) complex, but it also interacts with members of the SAM (The\nSorting and Assembly Machinery) complex to form the mitochondrial membrane\nspace bridging complex9. Recent studies have linked IMMT to the onset of\nvarious diseases, including cardiomyopathy10, degenerative encephalopathy11\nand kidney injury12. However, research on the significance of IMMT in cancers\nis rare, and the only literature proposed that IMMT expression might be\nrelated to cancer prognosis13,14. To date, few reports have been published on\nthe relationship between IMMT and the development and progression of BC, and\nthe functions of IMMT in BC remains largely undefined.\n\nThe purpose of this investigation was to delve into the potential functions\nand underlying biological processes of IMMT in the development and progression\nof BC. To achieve this objective, bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry\n(IHC) were utilized to determine the prognostic significance of IMMT and its\ncorrelation with clinicopathological parameters in BC patients.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

TUBA1C acts as a tumor promoter in most cancer types and is associated with poor prognosis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. MCM5 is important for the maintenance of the cellular chromosome compartment and is overexpressed in various types of cancer, including breast, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

This suggests that the PI3K pathway may play a crucial role in the downstream mechanism of PAX5.", "context": "Introduction\n\nIn terms of malignancies in women, breast cancer (BC) is the most common and\none of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide1. The mortality of BC\npatients has been significantly reduced by radical surgery, radiotherapy,\nchemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy within the past decade,\nbut many patients still experience recurrence or metastasis, eventually\nleading to death2. The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5. Mitochondria are the key organelles involved in\nmetabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, and maintaining mitochondrial\nintegrity is the absolute basis of oxidative phosphorylation6. In addition,\nprevious studies have also indicated that the number, structure, and function\nof mitochondria often change in malignant tumor cells to meet the needs of\nrapid growth in acidic and anoxic environments7.\n\nAs a key regulatory subunit of mitochondrial integrity, mitochondrial inner\nmembrane protein (IMMT), also known as Mic-60 or Mitofilin8, is not only an\nimportant part of the mitochondrial contact sites and cristae organization\nsystem (MICOS) complex, but it also interacts with members of the SAM (The\nSorting and Assembly Machinery) complex to form the mitochondrial membrane\nspace bridging complex9. Recent studies have linked IMMT to the onset of\nvarious diseases, including cardiomyopathy10, degenerative encephalopathy11\nand kidney injury12. However, research on the significance of IMMT in cancers\nis rare, and the only literature proposed that IMMT expression might be\nrelated to cancer prognosis13,14. To date, few reports have been published on\nthe relationship between IMMT and the development and progression of BC, and\nthe functions of IMMT in BC remains largely undefined.\n\nThe purpose of this investigation was to delve into the potential functions\nand underlying biological processes of IMMT in the development and progression\nof BC. To achieve this objective, bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry\n(IHC) were utilized to determine the prognostic significance of IMMT and its\ncorrelation with clinicopathological parameters in BC patients. Furthermore,\nin vitro experiments were conducted to assess the impact of IMMT on the\nproliferation and apoptosis of BC cells, and the morphological and functional\nchanges of mitochondria after IMMT knockdown (KD) were also evaluated.\nAdditionally, functional enrichment analysis and\n\n", "question": "What is the potential function of IMMT in the development and progression of BC?", "answer": "IMMT may play a role in the development and progression of BC by regulating mitochondrial integrity and metabolic reprogramming.", "prompt": "Re-write the question to ask in greater depth.

They also trigger ferroptosis-like therapy, inducing the generation of ROS and lipid peroxide accumulation, ultimately initiating ICD in tumor cells, activating CTLs, and enhancing immune memory. These mechanisms contribute to the promotion of anti-tumor immune responses and improvement of immunotherapy efficacy.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

In colorectal cancer, METTL3 overexpression has been linked to reduced cellular migration and invasion via the p38/ERK pathway.

Moreover, METTL3 has emerged as an independent risk factor for HNSCC patient prognosis. Its expression levels in HNSCC tissues are significantly increased compared to adjacent normal tissues. The mechanism behind METTL3's oncogenic role in HNSCC involves enhancing the m6A modification of CDC25B mRNA, thereby stabilizing it and upregulating its expression, which drives the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and malignant progression. Furthermore, METTL3 has been implicated in modulating the cellular response to cisplatin in HNSCC, with its knockdown affecting cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, and colony formation after cisplatin treatment.
