{"answer_new": "The Plasma-SeqSensei (PSS) ctDNA assays utilize molecular barcoding technology, specifically the Safe-SeqS method, which enhances the confidence of rare mutation detection by assigning a unique identifier to each template molecule prior to amplification, thereby correcting amplification and sequencing errors and achieving high sensitivity.", "question_new": "What are the technical underpinnings of the Plasma-SeqSensei (PSS) ctDNA assays, and how do they leverage molecular barcoding to achieve high-confidence detection of rare mutations?", "id": "PMC11006350-9", "context": "[126\u2013129]. However, this approach alone often falls short of achieving the\nhigh-confidence detection required for clinical applications. As such,\nmolecular barcoding has become crucial in enhancing the confidence of rare\nmutation detection in clinical applications. Safe-SeqS pioneered the use of\nmolecular barcodes [130], assigning a unique identifier (UID) to each template\nmolecule prior to amplification, enabling the identification of mutant PCR\nfragments with over 95 % identical mutations. This approach corrects\namplification and sequencing errors, achieving a sensitivity of 0.05 % allele\nfraction. Molecular barcoding also allows for the recognition of sequencing\nerrors by redundantly sequencing the progeny of each tagged molecule. If all\nprogenies contain the same mutation, it is deemed genuine (a \u2018supermutant\u2019),\nwhile mutations in only a subset of progeny are considered artifacts [130].\nThis technology forms the basis of the Plasma-SeqSensei\u2122 (PSS) ctDNA assays by\nSysmex, which detect 0.07 % and higher VAF with 95 % accuracy amid 10 000\nwild-type copies. They offer IVD kits for breast cancer to aid clinicians in\nmonitoring residual disease, recurrence, and (neo-)adjuvant responses, and for\nsolid cancers, including assessing RAS mutation status for CRC treatment\nsuitability. Additionally, RUO kits are available for detecting mutations in\nNSCLC, melanoma and thyroid, breast, and CRCs.\n\nFurther innovations in barcoding techniques led to additional improvements in\nsensitivity. Molecular barcoding techniques utilize exogenous and endogenous\nbarcodes [130]. Exogenous barcodes, consisting of specified or random\nnucleotides, can be added during library preparation or PCR. On the other\nhand, endogenous barcodes are created by the sequences at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends\nof template fragments and enable duplex sequencing [130,131]. This involves\nligating a semi-degenerated double-stranded unique barcoded adapter to a\ntarget double-stranded DNA, allowing the discernment of both Watson and Crick\nstrands based on their 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 directionality upon sequencing. This method\nsignificantly reduces sequencing errors, as it is unlikely for both strands to\ncontain the same erroneous mutation generated during library preparation or\nsequencing [132]. The theoretical sensitivity of this approach is impressive,\ndetecting one mutant molecule among 10^7, far surpassing conventional NGS\nmethods [133,134]. Various molecular barcoding strategies, using endogenous or\nexogenous barcodes, or a combination of both, have been developed for diverse\nclinical applications [85,89,135\u2013138]. A notable barcoding strategy appends\nidentical exogenous barcodes to both Watson and Crick strands of a template\nmolecule [133], ensuring unambiguous strand identification without relying on\nendogenous sequence ends and maintaining minimal error rates due to duplex\nsequencing.\n\nAlthough this method has the lowest error rate of any sequencing technology\ndescribed to date, two issues have limited its clinical applicability. First,\nit is challenging to convert a large fraction of the initial template\nmolecules to adapter-ligated fragments with the same barcode on each strand\n[126,133,139]. This issue is particularly problematic when the amount of\ninitial DNA is limiting, such as what is often found in liquid biopsy samples.\nSecond, hybridization-based capture is used to enrich desired regions of the\ngenome. While effective for enriching large regions of interest, hybridization\ncapture does not scale well for small target regions [140] and exhibits poor\nduplex recovery [126,139]. Sequential rounds of capture can partially overcome\nthese limitations, but existing hybridization capture-based methods typically\nrecover a minority of input molecules with sequence information from both\nstrands [139,141]. When the targeted region is very small (for example, one or\na few positions in the genome of particular interest) or the amount of DNA\navailable is limited (for example <33 ng, as\n\n", "question": "What technology forms the basis of the Plasma-SeqSensei (PSS) ctDNA assays?", "answer": "Molecular barcoding technology, specifically the Safe-SeqS method, forms the basis of the Plasma-SeqSensei (PSS) ctDNA assays.", "prompt": "Re-write the question to be more complex such that the corresponding answers require the use of precise and specific technical terms and defining them as needed."}

This approach corrects amplification and sequencing errors, achieving a sensitivity of 0.05% allele fraction.", "id": "PMC11006350-9", "context": "[126\u2013129]. However, this approach alone often falls short of achieving the\nhigh-confidence detection required for clinical applications. As such,\nmolecular barcoding has become crucial in enhancing the confidence of rare\nmutation detection in clinical applications. Safe-SeqS pioneered the use of\nmolecular barcodes [130], assigning a unique identifier (UID) to each template\nmolecule prior to amplification, enabling the identification of mutant PCR\nfragments with over 95 % identical mutations. This approach corrects\namplification and sequencing errors, achieving a sensitivity of 0.05 % allele\nfraction. Molecular barcoding also allows for the recognition of sequencing\nerrors by redundantly sequencing the progeny of each tagged molecule. If all\nprogenies contain the same mutation, it is deemed genuine (a \u2018supermutant\u2019),\nwhile mutations in only a subset of progeny are considered artifacts [130].\nThis technology forms the basis of the Plasma-SeqSensei\u2122 (PSS) ctDNA assays by\nSysmex, which detect 0.07 % and higher VAF with 95 % accuracy amid 10 000\nwild-type copies. They offer IVD kits for breast cancer to aid clinicians in\nmonitoring residual disease, recurrence, and (neo-)adjuvant responses, and for\nsolid cancers, including assessing RAS mutation status for CRC treatment\nsuitability. Additionally, RUO kits are available for detecting mutations in\nNSCLC, melanoma and thyroid, breast, and CRCs.\n\nFurther innovations in barcoding techniques led to additional improvements in\nsensitivity. Molecular barcoding techniques utilize exogenous and endogenous\nbarcodes [130]. Exogenous barcodes, consisting of specified or random\nnucleotides, can be added during library preparation or PCR. On the other\nhand, endogenous barcodes are created by the sequences at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends\nof template fragments and enable duplex sequencing [130,131]. This involves\nligating a semi-degenerated double-stranded unique barcoded adapter to a\ntarget double-stranded DNA, allowing the discernment of both Watson and Crick\nstrands based on their 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 directionality upon sequencing. This method\nsignificantly reduces sequencing errors, as it is unlikely for both strands to\ncontain the same erroneous mutation generated during library preparation or\nsequencing [132]. The theoretical sensitivity of this approach is impressive,\ndetecting one mutant molecule among 10^7, far surpassing conventional NGS\nmethods [133,134]. Various molecular barcoding strategies, using endogenous or\nexogenous barcodes, or a combination of both, have been developed for diverse\nclinical applications [85,89,135\u2013138]. A notable barcoding strategy appends\nidentical exogenous barcodes to both Watson and Crick strands of a template\nmolecule [133], ensuring unambiguous strand identification without relying on\nendogenous sequence ends and maintaining minimal error rates due to duplex\nsequencing.\n\nAlthough this method has the lowest error rate of any sequencing technology\ndescribed to date, two issues have limited its clinical applicability. First,\nit is challenging to convert a large fraction of the initial template\nmolecules to adapter-ligated fragments with the same barcode on each strand\n[126,133,139]. This issue is particularly problematic when the amount of\ninitial DNA is limiting, such as what is often found in liquid biopsy samples.\nSecond, hybridization-based capture is used to enrich desired regions of the\ngenome. While effective for enriching large regions of interest, hybridization\ncapture does not scale well for small target regions [140] and exhibits poor\nduplex recovery [126,139]. Sequential rounds of capture can partially overcome\nthese limitations, but existing hybridization capture-based methods typically\nrecover a minority of input molecules with sequence information from both\nstrands [139,141]. When the targeted region is very small (for example, one or\na few positions in the genome of particular interest) or the amount of DNA\navailable is limited (for example <33 ng, as\n\n", "question": "What technology forms the basis of the Plasma-SeqSensei (PSS) ctDNA assays?", "answer": "Molecular barcoding technology, specifically the Safe-SeqS method, forms the basis of the Plasma-SeqSensei (PSS) ctDNA assays.", "prompt": "Re-write the question such that its answer is not general and appropriately states exceptions and conditions to demonstrate a deep and nuanced understanding of the question."}

Specifically, the inhibition of FAK activation has been shown to induce early endocrine commitment by upregulating key transcription factors, such as NGN3, NEUROD1, and NKX2.2. Moreover, the limitation of FAK-dependent activation of the SMAD2/3 pathway has been implicated in promoting endocrine commitment, and the upregulation of Connexin 36 expression has been linked to the functional maturation of insulin-producing cells. Furthermore, the phosphorylation status of the FAK Y397 site is believed to best represent the activation or inhibition of FAK kinase activity, while Y576/577 can serve as a supportive reference.", "id": "PMC11140888-15", "context": "Discussion\n\nEnsuring and enhancing the efficiency of endodermal differentiation is an\nimportant step to further improve the quality of differentiated organoids. As\na nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, Src has been the subject of numerous\nstudies over three decades, in part, because of its association with malignant\ntransformation and oncogenesis [43]. SAR has been extensively studied and used\nfor cancer treatment; however, there have been no studies regarding its\napplication in the field of iPSC/ESC differentiation. In the present study, we\nfound for the first time that the Src inhibitor SAR exerts off-target effects\nto deactivate FAK under low concentration conditions, thereby promoting\nendodermal differentiation.\n\nNumerous studies have highlighted the pivotal role of FAK in early\ndevelopmental processes. For example, Afrikanova et al. demonstrated that the\nselective inhibition of FAK activation induces early endocrine commitment, as\nevidenced by an upregulation in the expression of key transcription factors,\nsuch as NGN3, NEUROD1, and NKX2.2 [44]. A parallel investigation by Liu et al.\ndemonstrated that 3D culture conditions play an important role in promoting\nendocrine commitment, which is consistent with some of our results. They\ndemonstrated that this effect is mediated by the limitation of FAK-dependent\nactivation of the SMAD2/3 pathway. Moreover, the functional maturation of\ninsulin-producing cells was enhanced in 3D culture, a phenomenon attributed to\nthe upregulation of Connexin 36 expression [45]. Previous studies provide\ncompelling evidence supporting the notion that 3D culture hampers the\nactivation of FAK, ultimately fostering commitment to the endocrine lineage\n[45]. These studies support the main findings of our study. Nonetheless, we\ndid not explore the impact of SAR on intercellular communication in the\npresent study, which represents an intriguing avenue for future studies. While\ncurrent research on stem cell differentiation into organoids has primarily\nfocused on phenotypic analyses, mechanistic studies remain less comprehensive.\nAcknowledging this gap, we advocate a paradigm shift toward identifying the\nunderlying mechanisms through which various small molecule drugs promote\ndifferentiation. Current studies have examined the downstream effects of FAK\nduring the differentiation process. Wrighton et al. revealed that\nextracellular signals modulate the autophosphorylation level at the\nintracellular FAK 397 site through integrin signaling, thereby regulating the\nactivation of the AKT pathway to balance the differentiation and self-renewal\nof embryonic stem cells [46]. Human FAK contains several tyrosine residues\nthat can be phosphorylated, including Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr576, Tyr577, and\nTyr925 [47]. Among these, Tyr397 is the most crucial phosphorylation site, the\nactivation of which can initiate downstream signaling. Tyr576 and Tyr577 are\nlocated within the kinase domain of FAK and serve as enhancers for the kinase\nactivity of FAK [48]. Phosphorylation of Y576/Y577 signifies full catalytical\nactivity of FAK [49]. Phosphorylated Y925 is a docking site for the adaptor\nprotein Grb2 [50], which links FAK signaling to the Ras/MAPK signaling\npathway. However, phosphorylated Y925 seems to have no direct relationship\nwith the tyrosine kinase activity of FAK. In summary, we believe that the\nphosphorylation status of the FAK Y397 site best represents the activation or\ninhibition of FAK kinase activity, while Y576/577 can serve as a supportive\nreference, and Y925 is not\n\n", "question": "What is the role of FAK in early developmental processes?", "answer": "FAK plays a pivotal role in early developmental processes, and its inhibition can induce early endocrine commitment.", "prompt": "Re-write the question to ask in greater depth.

While\ndevelopers proposed adopting 3D images for future versions, no clear benefit\nwas outlined4. However, its reliability is in question due to discrepancies\nbetween patient self-assessments (69.2% to 74.8%) and clinician assessments\n(25% to 83%).5 Additionally, BCCT.core's applicability is limited for patients\nunderwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS). This limitation arises because the\nsoftware's objective indices are primarily designed for patients who have\nundergone breast-conserving surgery.\n\nGAN model is a recently emerging novel technique widely adopted in field of\nimaging due to its exceptionally plausible ability to detect abnormalities\nbetween normal images by deep learning.

While our previous\nstudy demonstrated excellent predictive capability and highlighted the\ndetrimental effects of RT on patients with tissue expanders compared to\nautologous reconstruction, it was limited to a single institution and focused\non patients with tissue expanders at the time of analysis.\n\nTherefore, to comprehensively evaluate the influence of RT on permanent\nimplants, we validated the applicability of the previously developed GAN\nmodel. Additionally, we built a Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP)\nmodel incorporating relevant clinical factors to predict the likelihood of\nmajor complications after RT.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nWe computed the AS using a previously established fast anomaly generative\nadversarial network (f-AnoGAN) model. The f-AnoGAN model consists of two\nprimary components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator is trained\nto produce realistic medical images from random noise, while the discriminator\nis trained to distinguish between real and generated images. After training,\nthe model identifies anomalies by comparing real images to generated ones,\nhighlighting discrepancies. This approach leverages the unsupervised learning\ncapabilities of GANs to efficiently identify and localize anomalies without\nthe need for labeled data.

Given that BCCT.core is the only established modality for\nevaluating aesthetic outcomes in postoperative breast cancer patients, it has\nbeen widely adopted in research, including recent prospective trials1\u20133. While\ndevelopers proposed adopting 3D images for future versions, no clear benefit\nwas outlined4. However, its reliability is in question due to discrepancies\nbetween patient self-assessments (69.2% to 74.8%) and clinician assessments\n(25% to 83%).5 Additionally, BCCT.core's applicability is limited for patients\nunderwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS). This limitation arises because the\nsoftware's objective indices are primarily designed for patients who have\nundergone breast-conserving surgery.\n\nGAN model is a recently emerging novel technique widely adopted in field of\nimaging due to its exceptionally plausible ability to detect abnormalities\nbetween normal images by deep learning. Building upon our prior work\nestablishing the feasibility of a GAN-based Anomaly score (AS) for predicting\ncosmetic outcomes in breast cancer patients, we explored the long-term impact\nof radiotherapy (RT) on patients with permanent implants5. While our previous\nstudy demonstrated excellent predictive capability and highlighted the\ndetrimental effects of RT on patients with tissue expanders compared to\nautologous reconstruction, it was limited to a single institution and focused\non patients with tissue expanders at the time of analysis.\n\nTherefore, to comprehensively evaluate the influence of RT on permanent\nimplants, we validated the applicability of the previously developed GAN\nmodel. Additionally, we built a Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP)\nmodel incorporating relevant clinical factors to predict the likelihood of\nmajor complications after RT.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nWe computed the AS using a previously established fast anomaly generative\nadversarial network (f-AnoGAN) model. The f-AnoGAN model consists of two\nprimary components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator is trained\nto produce realistic medical images from random noise, while the discriminator\nis trained to distinguish between real and generated images. After training,\nthe model identifies anomalies by comparing real images to generated ones,\nhighlighting discrepancies. This approach leverages the unsupervised learning\ncapabilities of GANs to efficiently identify and localize anomalies without\nthe need for labeled data. As described in our previous research, the f-AnoGAN\nmodel was trained using normal breast images from 251 patients who underwent\nBCS5. The validation dataset consisted of 82 breast cancer patients who\nunderwent immediate reconstruction surgery followed by radiotherapy between\nJanuary 2016 and December 2020. This study received review and approval from\nthe Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital (IRB No.\n2304-009-1418).\n\nFor each patient, CT images were obtained at four different time points: RT\nsimulation, the 1st follow-up, 1 year after completion of radiotherapy\n(Post-1Y), and 2 years after completion of radiotherapy (Post-2Y). We created\n3D renderings for each patient using the Digital Imaging and Communications in\nMedicine (DICOM) images acquired from the CT scans.

As\na nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, Src has been the subject of numerous\nstudies over three decades, in part, because of its association with malignant\ntransformation and oncogenesis [43]. SAR has been extensively studied and used\nfor cancer treatment; however, there have been no studies regarding its\napplication in the field of iPSC/ESC differentiation. In the present study, we\nfound for the first time that the Src inhibitor SAR exerts off-target effects\nto deactivate FAK under low concentration conditions, thereby promoting\nendodermal differentiation.\n\nNumerous studies have highlighted the pivotal role of FAK in early\ndevelopmental processes. For example, Afrikanova et al. demonstrated that the\nselective inhibition of FAK activation induces early endocrine commitment, as\nevidenced by an upregulation in the expression of key transcription factors,\nsuch as NGN3, NEUROD1, and NKX2.2 [44]. A parallel investigation by Liu et al.\ndemonstrated that 3D culture conditions play an important role in promoting\nendocrine commitment, which is consistent with some of our results. They\ndemonstrated that this effect is mediated by the limitation of FAK-dependent\nactivation of the SMAD2/3 pathway. Moreover, the functional maturation of\ninsulin-producing cells was enhanced in 3D culture, a phenomenon attributed to\nthe upregulation of Connexin 36 expression [45]. Previous studies provide\ncompelling evidence supporting the notion that 3D culture hampers the\nactivation of FAK, ultimately fostering commitment to the endocrine lineage\n[45]. These studies support the main findings of our study. Nonetheless, we\ndid not explore the impact of SAR on intercellular communication in the\npresent study, which represents an intriguing avenue for future studies. While\ncurrent research on stem cell differentiation into organoids has primarily\nfocused on phenotypic analyses, mechanistic studies remain less comprehensive.\nAcknowledging this gap, we advocate a paradigm shift toward identifying the\nunderlying mechanisms through which various small molecule drugs promote\ndifferentiation. Current studies have examined the downstream effects of FAK\nduring the differentiation process. Wrighton et al. revealed that\nextracellular signals modulate the autophosphorylation level at the\nintracellular FAK 397 site through integrin signaling, thereby regulating the\nactivation of the AKT pathway to balance the differentiation and self-renewal\nof embryonic stem cells [46]. Human FAK contains several tyrosine residues\nthat can be phosphorylated, including Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr576, Tyr577, and\nTyr925 [47]. Among these, Tyr397 is the most crucial phosphorylation site, the\nactivation of which can initiate downstream signaling. Tyr576 and Tyr577 are\nlocated within the kinase domain of FAK and serve as enhancers for the kinase\nactivity of FAK [48]. Phosphorylation of Y576/Y577 signifies full catalytical\nactivity of FAK [49]. Phosphorylated Y925 is a docking site for the adaptor\nprotein Grb2 [50], which links FAK signaling to the Ras/MAPK signaling\npathway. However, phosphorylated Y925 seems to have no direct relationship\nwith the tyrosine kinase activity of FAK. In summary, we believe that the\nphosphorylation status of the FAK Y397 site best represents the activation or\ninhibition of FAK kinase activity, while Y576/577 can serve as a supportive\nreference, and Y925 is not\n\n", "question": "What is the role of FAK in early developmental processes?", "answer": "FAK plays a pivotal role in early developmental processes, and its inhibition can induce early endocrine commitment.", "prompt": "Re-write the question to ask in greater depth.

As\na nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, Src has been the subject of numerous\nstudies over three decades, in part, because of its association with malignant\ntransformation and oncogenesis [43]. SAR has been extensively studied and used\nfor cancer treatment; however, there have been no studies regarding its\napplication in the field of iPSC/ESC differentiation. In the present study, we\nfound for the first time that the Src inhibitor SAR exerts off-target effects\nto deactivate FAK under low concentration conditions, thereby promoting\nendodermal differentiation.\n\nNumerous studies have highlighted the pivotal role of FAK in early\ndevelopmental processes. For example, Afrikanova et al. demonstrated that the\nselective inhibition of FAK activation induces early endocrine commitment, as\nevidenced by an upregulation in the expression of key transcription factors,\nsuch as NGN3, NEUROD1, and NKX2.2 [44]. A parallel investigation by Liu et al.\ndemonstrated that 3D culture conditions play an important role in promoting\nendocrine commitment, which is consistent with some of our results. They\ndemonstrated that this effect is mediated by the limitation of FAK-dependent\nactivation of the SMAD2/3 pathway. Moreover, the functional maturation of\ninsulin-producing cells was enhanced in 3D culture, a phenomenon attributed to\nthe upregulation of Connexin 36 expression [45]. Previous studies provide\ncompelling evidence supporting the notion that 3D culture hampers the\nactivation of FAK, ultimately fostering commitment to the endocrine lineage\n[45]. These studies support the main findings of our study. Nonetheless, we\ndid not explore the impact of SAR on intercellular communication in the\npresent study, which represents an intriguing avenue for future studies. While\ncurrent research on stem cell differentiation into organoids has primarily\nfocused on phenotypic analyses, mechanistic studies remain less comprehensive.\nAcknowledging this gap, we advocate a paradigm shift toward identifying the\nunderlying mechanisms through which various small molecule drugs promote\ndifferentiation. Current studies have examined the downstream effects of FAK\nduring the differentiation process. Wrighton et al. revealed that\nextracellular signals modulate the autophosphorylation level at the\nintracellular FAK 397 site through integrin signaling, thereby regulating the\nactivation of the AKT pathway to balance the differentiation and self-renewal\nof embryonic stem cells [46]. Human FAK contains several tyrosine residues\nthat can be phosphorylated, including Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr576, Tyr577, and\nTyr925 [47]. Among these, Tyr397 is the most crucial phosphorylation site, the\nactivation of which can initiate downstream signaling. Tyr576 and Tyr577 are\nlocated within the kinase domain of FAK and serve as enhancers for the kinase\nactivity of FAK [48]. Phosphorylation of Y576/Y577 signifies full catalytical\nactivity of FAK [49]. Phosphorylated Y925 is a docking site for the adaptor\nprotein Grb2 [50], which links FAK signaling to the Ras/MAPK signaling\npathway. However, phosphorylated Y925 seems to have no direct relationship\nwith the tyrosine kinase activity of FAK. In summary, we believe that the\nphosphorylation status of the FAK Y397 site best represents the activation or\ninhibition of FAK kinase activity, while Y576/577 can serve as a supportive\nreference, and Y925 is not\n\n", "question": "What is the role of FAK in early developmental processes?", "answer": "FAK plays a pivotal role in early developmental processes, and its inhibition can induce early endocrine commitment.", "prompt": "Re-write the question to ask in greater depth.

As\na nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, Src has been the subject of numerous\nstudies over three decades, in part, because of its association with malignant\ntransformation and oncogenesis [43]. SAR has been extensively studied and used\nfor cancer treatment; however, there have been no studies regarding its\napplication in the field of iPSC/ESC differentiation. In the present study, we\nfound for the first time that the Src inhibitor SAR exerts off-target effects\nto deactivate FAK under low concentration conditions, thereby promoting\nendodermal differentiation.\n\nNumerous studies have highlighted the pivotal role of FAK in early\ndevelopmental processes. For example, Afrikanova et al. demonstrated that the\nselective inhibition of FAK activation induces early endocrine commitment, as\nevidenced by an upregulation in the expression of key transcription factors,\nsuch as NGN3, NEUROD1, and NKX2.2 [44]. A parallel investigation by Liu et al.\ndemonstrated that 3D culture conditions play an important role in promoting\nendocrine commitment, which is consistent with some of our results. They\ndemonstrated that this effect is mediated by the limitation of FAK-dependent\nactivation of the SMAD2/3 pathway. Moreover, the functional maturation of\ninsulin-producing cells was enhanced in 3D culture, a phenomenon attributed to\nthe upregulation of Connexin 36 expression [45]. Previous studies provide\ncompelling evidence supporting the notion that 3D culture hampers the\nactivation of FAK, ultimately fostering commitment to the endocrine lineage\n[45]. These studies support the main findings of our study. Nonetheless, we\ndid not explore the impact of SAR on intercellular communication in the\npresent study, which represents an intriguing avenue for future studies. While\ncurrent research on stem cell differentiation into organoids has primarily\nfocused on phenotypic analyses, mechanistic studies remain less comprehensive.\nAcknowledging this gap, we advocate a paradigm shift toward identifying the\nunderlying mechanisms through which various small molecule drugs promote\ndifferentiation. Current studies have examined the downstream effects of FAK\nduring the differentiation process. Wrighton et al. revealed that\nextracellular signals modulate the autophosphorylation level at the\nintracellular FAK 397 site through integrin signaling, thereby regulating the\nactivation of the AKT pathway to balance the differentiation and self-renewal\nof embryonic stem cells [46]. Human FAK contains several tyrosine residues\nthat can be phosphorylated, including Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr576, Tyr577, and\nTyr925 [47]. Among these, Tyr397 is the most crucial phosphorylation site, the\nactivation of which can initiate downstream signaling. Tyr576 and Tyr577 are\nlocated within the kinase domain of FAK and serve as enhancers for the kinase\nactivity of FAK [48]. Phosphorylation of Y576/Y577 signifies full catalytical\nactivity of FAK [49]. Phosphorylated Y925 is a docking site for the adaptor\nprotein Grb2 [50], which links FAK signaling to the Ras/MAPK signaling\npathway. However, phosphorylated Y925 seems to have no direct relationship\nwith the tyrosine kinase activity of FAK. In summary, we believe that the\nphosphorylation status of the FAK Y397 site best represents the activation or\ninhibition of FAK kinase activity, while Y576/577 can serve as a supportive\nreference, and Y925 is not\n\n", "question": "What is the role of FAK in early developmental processes?", "answer": "FAK plays a pivotal role in early developmental processes, and its inhibition can induce early endocrine commitment.", "prompt": "Re-write the question to ask in greater depth.

On one hand, senescence acts as a tumor-suppressive mechanism through cell cycle arrest, preventing the proliferation of damaged cells. On the other hand, senescent cells can also have an oncogenic impact through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can promote tumor progression, drug resistance, and metastasis. The SASP can also amplify its signals through autocrine and paracrine positive feedback loops, further supporting tumor growth.

This conclusion is based on a study that used inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) adjustment to analyze the incidence of breast cancer among patients with and without a history of myocardial infarction (MI).

Additionally, sensitivity analysis with different lag periods also revealed no significant association between MI and breast cancer over time. Therefore, the study suggests that there is no significant correlation between myocardial infarction and breast cancer incidence.", "id": "PMC11140888-15", "context": "Discussion\n\nEnsuring and enhancing the efficiency of endodermal differentiation is an\nimportant step to further improve the quality of differentiated organoids. As\na nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, Src has been the subject of numerous\nstudies over three decades, in part, because of its association with malignant\ntransformation and oncogenesis [43]. SAR has been extensively studied and used\nfor cancer treatment; however, there have been no studies regarding its\napplication in the field of iPSC/ESC differentiation. In the present study, we\nfound for the first time that the Src inhibitor SAR exerts off-target effects\nto deactivate FAK under low concentration conditions, thereby promoting\nendodermal differentiation.\n\nNumerous studies have highlighted the pivotal role of FAK in early\ndevelopmental processes. For example, Afrikanova et al. demonstrated that the\nselective inhibition of FAK activation induces early endocrine commitment, as\nevidenced by an upregulation in the expression of key transcription factors,\nsuch as NGN3, NEUROD1, and NKX2.2 [44]. A parallel investigation by Liu et al.\ndemonstrated that 3D culture conditions play an important role in promoting\nendocrine commitment, which is consistent with some of our results. They\ndemonstrated that this effect is mediated by the limitation of FAK-dependent\nactivation of the SMAD2/3 pathway. Moreover, the functional maturation of\ninsulin-producing cells was enhanced in 3D culture, a phenomenon attributed to\nthe upregulation of Connexin 36 expression [45]. Previous studies provide\ncompelling evidence supporting the notion that 3D culture hampers the\nactivation of FAK, ultimately fostering commitment to the endocrine lineage\n[45]. These studies support the main findings of our study. Nonetheless, we\ndid not explore the impact of SAR on intercellular communication in the\npresent study, which represents an intriguing avenue for future studies. While\ncurrent research on stem cell differentiation into organoids has primarily\nfocused on phenotypic analyses, mechanistic studies remain less comprehensive.\nAcknowledging this gap, we advocate a paradigm shift toward identifying the\nunderlying mechanisms through which various small molecule drugs promote\ndifferentiation. Current studies have examined the downstream effects of FAK\nduring the differentiation process. Wrighton et al. revealed that\nextracellular signals modulate the autophosphorylation level at the\nintracellular FAK 397 site through integrin signaling, thereby regulating the\nactivation of the AKT pathway to balance the differentiation and self-renewal\nof embryonic stem cells [46]. Human FAK contains several tyrosine residues\nthat can be phosphorylated, including Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr576, Tyr577, and\nTyr925 [47]. Among these, Tyr397 is the most crucial phosphorylation site, the\nactivation of which can initiate downstream signaling. Tyr576 and Tyr577 are\nlocated within the kinase domain of FAK and serve as enhancers for the kinase\nactivity of FAK [48]. Phosphorylation of Y576/Y577 signifies full catalytical\nactivity of FAK [49]. Phosphorylated Y925 is a docking site for the adaptor\nprotein Grb2 [50], which links FAK signaling to the Ras/MAPK signaling\npathway. However, phosphorylated Y925 seems to have no direct relationship\nwith the tyrosine kinase activity of FAK. In summary, we believe that the\nphosphorylation status of the FAK Y397 site best represents the activation or\ninhibition of FAK kinase activity, while Y576/577 can serve as a supportive\nreference, and Y925 is not\n\n", "question": "What is the role of FAK in early developmental processes?", "answer": "FAK plays a pivotal role in early developmental processes, and its inhibition can induce early endocrine commitment.", "prompt": "Re-write the question to ask in greater depth.

Given that BCCT.core is the only established modality for\nevaluating aesthetic outcomes in postoperative breast cancer patients, it has\nbeen widely adopted in research, including recent prospective trials1\u20133. While\ndevelopers proposed adopting 3D images for future versions, no clear benefit\nwas outlined4. However, its reliability is in question due to discrepancies\nbetween patient self-assessments (69.2% to 74.8%) and clinician assessments\n(25% to 83%).5 Additionally, BCCT.core's applicability is limited for patients\nunderwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS). This limitation arises because the\nsoftware's objective indices are primarily designed for patients who have\nundergone breast-conserving surgery.\n\nGAN model is a recently emerging novel technique widely adopted in field of\nimaging due to its exceptionally plausible ability to detect abnormalities\nbetween normal images by deep learning. Building upon our prior work\nestablishing the feasibility of a GAN-based Anomaly score (AS) for predicting\ncosmetic outcomes in breast cancer patients, we explored the long-term impact\nof radiotherapy (RT) on patients with permanent implants5. While our previous\nstudy demonstrated excellent predictive capability and highlighted the\ndetrimental effects of RT on patients with tissue expanders compared to\nautologous reconstruction, it was limited to a single institution and focused\non patients with tissue expanders at the time of analysis.\n\nTherefore, to comprehensively evaluate the influence of RT on permanent\nimplants, we validated the applicability of the previously developed GAN\nmodel. Additionally, we built a Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP)\nmodel incorporating relevant clinical factors to predict the likelihood of\nmajor complications after RT.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nWe computed the AS using a previously established fast anomaly generative\nadversarial network (f-AnoGAN) model. The f-AnoGAN model consists of two\nprimary components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator is trained\nto produce realistic medical images from random noise, while the discriminator\nis trained to distinguish between real and generated images. After training,\nthe model identifies anomalies by comparing real images to generated ones,\nhighlighting discrepancies. This approach leverages the unsupervised learning\ncapabilities of GANs to efficiently identify and localize anomalies without\nthe need for labeled data. As described in our previous research, the f-AnoGAN\nmodel was trained using normal breast images from 251 patients who underwent\nBCS5. The validation dataset consisted of 82 breast cancer patients who\nunderwent immediate reconstruction surgery followed by radiotherapy between\nJanuary 2016 and December 2020. This study received review and approval from\nthe Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital (IRB No.\n2304-009-1418).\n\nFor each patient, CT images were obtained at four different time points: RT\nsimulation, the 1st follow-up, 1 year after completion of radiotherapy\n(Post-1Y), and 2 years after completion of radiotherapy (Post-2Y). We created\n3D renderings for each patient using the Digital Imaging and Communications in\nMedicine (DICOM) images acquired from the CT scans.

Moreover, the factors controlling the shift of METTL3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and its subsequent activation for RNA binding and translation initiation remain unclear. It is also uncertain whether this phenomenon is unique to cancer cells or plays a role in normal cellular function. The regulation of nuclear/cytoplasmic localization and the potential involvement of signaling pathways or other proteins in directing METTL3 and METTL16 to the cytoplasm and target mRNAs require further exploration.", "id": "PMC11140888-15", "context": "Discussion\n\nEnsuring and enhancing the efficiency of endodermal differentiation is an\nimportant step to further improve the quality of differentiated organoids. As\na nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, Src has been the subject of numerous\nstudies over three decades, in part, because of its association with malignant\ntransformation and oncogenesis [43]. SAR has been extensively studied and used\nfor cancer treatment; however, there have been no studies regarding its\napplication in the field of iPSC/ESC differentiation. In the present study, we\nfound for the first time that the Src inhibitor SAR exerts off-target effects\nto deactivate FAK under low concentration conditions, thereby promoting\nendodermal differentiation.\n\nNumerous studies have highlighted the pivotal role of FAK in early\ndevelopmental processes. For example, Afrikanova et al. demonstrated that the\nselective inhibition of FAK activation induces early endocrine commitment, as\nevidenced by an upregulation in the expression of key transcription factors,\nsuch as NGN3, NEUROD1, and NKX2.2 [44]. A parallel investigation by Liu et al.\ndemonstrated that 3D culture conditions play an important role in promoting\nendocrine commitment, which is consistent with some of our results. They\ndemonstrated that this effect is mediated by the limitation of FAK-dependent\nactivation of the SMAD2/3 pathway. Moreover, the functional maturation of\ninsulin-producing cells was enhanced in 3D culture, a phenomenon attributed to\nthe upregulation of Connexin 36 expression [45]. Previous studies provide\ncompelling evidence supporting the notion that 3D culture hampers the\nactivation of FAK, ultimately fostering commitment to the endocrine lineage\n[45]. These studies support the main findings of our study. Nonetheless, we\ndid not explore the impact of SAR on intercellular communication in the\npresent study, which represents an intriguing avenue for future studies. While\ncurrent research on stem cell differentiation into organoids has primarily\nfocused on phenotypic analyses, mechanistic studies remain less comprehensive.\nAcknowledging this gap, we advocate a paradigm shift toward identifying the\nunderlying mechanisms through which various small molecule drugs promote\ndifferentiation. Current studies have examined the downstream effects of FAK\nduring the differentiation process. Wrighton et al. revealed that\nextracellular signals modulate the autophosphorylation level at the\nintracellular FAK 397 site through integrin signaling, thereby regulating the\nactivation of the AKT pathway to balance the differentiation and self-renewal\nof embryonic stem cells [46]. Human FAK contains several tyrosine residues\nthat can be phosphorylated, including Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr576, Tyr577, and\nTyr925 [47]. Among these, Tyr397 is the most crucial phosphorylation site, the\nactivation of which can initiate downstream signaling. Tyr576 and Tyr577 are\nlocated within the kinase domain of FAK and serve as enhancers for the kinase\nactivity of FAK [48]. Phosphorylation of Y576/Y577 signifies full catalytical\nactivity of FAK [49]. Phosphorylated Y925 is a docking site for the adaptor\nprotein Grb2 [50], which links FAK signaling to the Ras/MAPK signaling\npathway. However, phosphorylated Y925 seems to have no direct relationship\nwith the tyrosine kinase activity of FAK. In summary, we believe that the\nphosphorylation status of the FAK Y397 site best represents the activation or\ninhibition of FAK kinase activity, while Y576/577 can serve as a supportive\nreference, and Y925 is not\n\n", "question": "What is the role of FAK in early developmental processes?", "answer": "FAK plays a pivotal role in early developmental processes, and its inhibition can induce early endocrine commitment.", "prompt": "Re-write the question to ask in greater depth.

Its purpose is to assess the feasibility of implementing an\nindividualized program; further research is required to evaluate the\neffectiveness of DEFACTO2 in relation to variations in PA and SB.\n\nInclusion Criteria\n\nEligible participants are aged between 18 and 75 years old to avoid geriatric\noncology [55] and to ensure population homogeneity in the feasibility study.\nThey must be survivors of primary nonmetastatic breast, lung, prostate or\ncolorectal cancer (stage 1 to 3, including primary, second cancer, and\nrelapse), have completed chemo-radio-immunotherapy treatments within the past\n3 weeks to 20 years, have no contraindications for individual discovery\nsession of APA, be willing to commit to the DEFACTO2 3-month program and\n12-month follow-up, be physically inactive and sedentary (ie, <150 min/week of\nmoderate PA or <75 min/week of vigorous PA, with an average of 5 h/day or more\nof SB), be proficient in reading, understanding and speaking French, be\ncapable of using the connected device (Garmin Vivosmart 4 [Garmin\nInternational Inc]) and performing basic operations (eg, pressing a button and\ncharging the battery), possesses a smartphone or a computer to download the\nGarmin Connect app (Garmin International Inc), be able to walk unassisted (to\nprevent bias in connected device data), reside in France, and have signed the\nconsent form.\n\nDEFACTO2 targets physically inactive and sedentary cancer survivors, aiming to\nincrease their PA to meet established guidelines [21,56]. A total of 145\nparticipants are required to detect a change of 75 minutes of moderate-\nintensity PA per week between before and after the 3-month intervention, with\nan output of 90% and a 5% risk (2-sided). This calculation is based on a\nmoderate intensity PA variation of 75 min/week according to the study of Lynch\net al [57], an average moderate-intensity PA of 50.6 (SD 48.2) min/week in a\nsubset of physically inactive cancer survivors from the DEFACTO1 study (not\nyet published), and a common SD of 140, considering the SD of moderate PA\naverages observed before and after the intervention in Lynch et al [57]\u2019s\nstudy.\n\nRecruitment\n\nInformation is disseminated among League Against Cancer committees, with calls\nfor participation in the health education program sent through email. The 15\nparticipating committees inform cancer survivors who meet the inclusion\ncriteria, after which interested individuals contact the principal\ninvestigator through email or phone to schedule an appointment.

A parallel investigation by Liu et al.\ndemonstrated that 3D culture conditions play an important role in promoting\nendocrine commitment, which is consistent with some of our results.

While our previous\nstudy demonstrated excellent predictive capability and highlighted the\ndetrimental effects of RT on patients with tissue expanders compared to\nautologous reconstruction, it was limited to a single institution and focused\non patients with tissue expanders at the time of analysis.\n\nTherefore, to comprehensively evaluate the influence of RT on permanent\nimplants, we validated the applicability of the previously developed GAN\nmodel. Additionally, we built a Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP)\nmodel incorporating relevant clinical factors to predict the likelihood of\nmajor complications after RT.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nWe computed the AS using a previously established fast anomaly generative\nadversarial network (f-AnoGAN) model. The f-AnoGAN model consists of two\nprimary components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator is trained\nto produce realistic medical images from random noise, while the discriminator\nis trained to distinguish between real and generated images. After training,\nthe model identifies anomalies by comparing real images to generated ones,\nhighlighting discrepancies. This approach leverages the unsupervised learning\ncapabilities of GANs to efficiently identify and localize anomalies without\nthe need for labeled data. As described in our previous research, the f-AnoGAN\nmodel was trained using normal breast images from 251 patients who underwent\nBCS5. The validation dataset consisted of 82 breast cancer patients who\nunderwent immediate reconstruction surgery followed by radiotherapy between\nJanuary 2016 and December 2020. This study received review and approval from\nthe Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital (IRB No.\n2304-009-1418).\n\nFor each patient, CT images were obtained at four different time points: RT\nsimulation, the 1st follow-up, 1 year after completion of radiotherapy\n(Post-1Y), and 2 years after completion of radiotherapy (Post-2Y). We created\n3D renderings for each patient using the Digital Imaging and Communications in\nMedicine (DICOM) images acquired from the CT scans.

As\na nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, Src has been the subject of numerous\nstudies over three decades, in part, because of its association with malignant\ntransformation and oncogenesis [43]. SAR has been extensively studied and used\nfor cancer treatment; however, there have been no studies regarding its\napplication in the field of iPSC/ESC differentiation. In the present study, we\nfound for the first time that the Src inhibitor SAR exerts off-target effects\nto deactivate FAK under low concentration conditions, thereby promoting\nendodermal differentiation.\n\nNumerous studies have highlighted the pivotal role of FAK in early\ndevelopmental processes. For example, Afrikanova et al. demonstrated that the\nselective inhibition of FAK activation induces early endocrine commitment, as\nevidenced by an upregulation in the expression of key transcription factors,\nsuch as NGN3, NEUROD1, and NKX2.2 [44]. A parallel investigation by Liu et al.\ndemonstrated that 3D culture conditions play an important role in promoting\nendocrine commitment, which is consistent with some of our results. They\ndemonstrated that this effect is mediated by the limitation of FAK-dependent\nactivation of the SMAD2/3 pathway. Moreover, the functional maturation of\ninsulin-producing cells was enhanced in 3D culture, a phenomenon attributed to\nthe upregulation of Connexin 36 expression [45]. Previous studies provide\ncompelling evidence supporting the notion that 3D culture hampers the\nactivation of FAK, ultimately fostering commitment to the endocrine lineage\n[45]. These studies support the main findings of our study. Nonetheless, we\ndid not explore the impact of SAR on intercellular communication in the\npresent study, which represents an intriguing avenue for future studies. While\ncurrent research on stem cell differentiation into organoids has primarily\nfocused on phenotypic analyses, mechanistic studies remain less comprehensive.\nAcknowledging this gap, we advocate a paradigm shift toward identifying the\nunderlying mechanisms through which various small molecule drugs promote\ndifferentiation. Current studies have examined the downstream effects of FAK\nduring the differentiation process. Wrighton et al. revealed that\nextracellular signals modulate the autophosphorylation level at the\nintracellular FAK 397 site through integrin signaling, thereby regulating the\nactivation of the AKT pathway to balance the differentiation and self-renewal\nof embryonic stem cells [46]. Human FAK contains several tyrosine residues\nthat can be phosphorylated, including Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr576, Tyr577, and\nTyr925 [47]. Among these, Tyr397 is the most crucial phosphorylation site, the\nactivation of which can initiate downstream signaling. Tyr576 and Tyr577 are\nlocated within the kinase domain of FAK and serve as enhancers for the kinase\nactivity of FAK [48]. Phosphorylation of Y576/Y577 signifies full catalytical\nactivity of FAK [49]. Phosphorylated Y925 is a docking site for the adaptor\nprotein Grb2 [50], which links FAK signaling to the Ras/MAPK signaling\npathway. However, phosphorylated Y925 seems to have no direct relationship\nwith the tyrosine kinase activity of FAK. In summary, we believe that the\nphosphorylation status of the FAK Y397 site best represents the activation or\ninhibition of FAK kinase activity, while Y576/577 can serve as a supportive\nreference, and Y925 is not\n\n", "question": "What is the role of FAK in early developmental processes?", "answer": "FAK plays a pivotal role in early developmental processes, and its inhibition can induce early endocrine commitment.", "prompt": "Re-write the question to ask in greater depth.

As\na nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, Src has been the subject of numerous\nstudies over three decades, in part, because of its association with malignant\ntransformation and oncogenesis [43]. SAR has been extensively studied and used\nfor cancer treatment; however, there have been no studies regarding its\napplication in the field of iPSC/ESC differentiation. In the present study, we\nfound for the first time that the Src inhibitor SAR exerts off-target effects\nto deactivate FAK under low concentration conditions, thereby promoting\nendodermal differentiation.\n\nNumerous studies have highlighted the pivotal role of FAK in early\ndevelopmental processes. For example, Afrikanova et al. demonstrated that the\nselective inhibition of FAK activation induces early endocrine commitment, as\nevidenced by an upregulation in the expression of key transcription factors,\nsuch as NGN3, NEUROD1, and NKX2.2 [44]. A parallel investigation by Liu et al.\ndemonstrated that 3D culture conditions play an important role in promoting\nendocrine commitment, which is consistent with some of our results. They\ndemonstrated that this effect is mediated by the limitation of FAK-dependent\nactivation of the SMAD2/3 pathway. Moreover, the functional maturation of\ninsulin-producing cells was enhanced in 3D culture, a phenomenon attributed to\nthe upregulation of Connexin 36 expression [45]. Previous studies provide\ncompelling evidence supporting the notion that 3D culture hampers the\nactivation of FAK, ultimately fostering commitment to the endocrine lineage\n[45]. These studies support the main findings of our study. Nonetheless, we\ndid not explore the impact of SAR on intercellular communication in the\npresent study, which represents an intriguing avenue for future studies. While\ncurrent research on stem cell differentiation into organoids has primarily\nfocused on phenotypic analyses, mechanistic studies remain less comprehensive.\nAcknowledging this gap, we advocate a paradigm shift toward identifying the\nunderlying mechanisms through which various small molecule drugs promote\ndifferentiation. Current studies have examined the downstream effects of FAK\nduring the differentiation process. Wrighton et al. revealed that\nextracellular signals modulate the autophosphorylation level at the\nintracellular FAK 397 site through integrin signaling, thereby regulating the\nactivation of the AKT pathway to balance the differentiation and self-renewal\nof embryonic stem cells [46]. Human FAK contains several tyrosine residues\nthat can be phosphorylated, including Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr576, Tyr577, and\nTyr925 [47]. Among these, Tyr397 is the most crucial phosphorylation site, the\nactivation of which can initiate downstream signaling. Tyr576 and Tyr577 are\nlocated within the kinase domain of FAK and serve as enhancers for the kinase\nactivity of FAK [48]. Phosphorylation of Y576/Y577 signifies full catalytical\nactivity of FAK [49]. Phosphorylated Y925 is a docking site for the adaptor\nprotein Grb2 [50], which links FAK signaling to the Ras/MAPK signaling\npathway. However, phosphorylated Y925 seems to have no direct relationship\nwith the tyrosine kinase activity of FAK. In summary, we believe that the\nphosphorylation status of the FAK Y397 site best represents the activation or\ninhibition of FAK kinase activity, while Y576/577 can serve as a supportive\nreference, and Y925 is not\n\n", "question": "What is the role of FAK in early developmental processes?", "answer": "FAK plays a pivotal role in early developmental processes, and its inhibition can induce early endocrine commitment.", "prompt": "Re-write the question to ask in greater depth.

After training,\nthe model identifies anomalies by comparing real images to generated ones,\nhighlighting discrepancies.

As\na nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, Src has been the subject of numerous\nstudies over three decades, in part, because of its association with malignant\ntransformation and oncogenesis [43]. SAR has been extensively studied and used\nfor cancer treatment; however, there have been no studies regarding its\napplication in the field of iPSC/ESC differentiation. In the present study, we\nfound for the first time that the Src inhibitor SAR exerts off-target effects\nto deactivate FAK under low concentration conditions, thereby promoting\nendodermal differentiation.\n\nNumerous studies have highlighted the pivotal role of FAK in early\ndevelopmental processes. For example, Afrikanova et al. demonstrated that the\nselective inhibition of FAK activation induces early endocrine commitment, as\nevidenced by an upregulation in the expression of key transcription factors,\nsuch as NGN3, NEUROD1, and NKX2.2 [44]. A parallel investigation by Liu et al.\ndemonstrated that 3D culture conditions play an important role in promoting\nendocrine commitment, which is consistent with some of our results. They\ndemonstrated that this effect is mediated by the limitation of FAK-dependent\nactivation of the SMAD2/3 pathway. Moreover, the functional maturation of\ninsulin-producing cells was enhanced in 3D culture, a phenomenon attributed to\nthe upregulation of Connexin 36 expression [45]. Previous studies provide\ncompelling evidence supporting the notion that 3D culture hampers the\nactivation of FAK, ultimately fostering commitment to the endocrine lineage\n[45]. These studies support the main findings of our study. Nonetheless, we\ndid not explore the impact of SAR on intercellular communication in the\npresent study, which represents an intriguing avenue for future studies. While\ncurrent research on stem cell differentiation into organoids has primarily\nfocused on phenotypic analyses, mechanistic studies remain less comprehensive.\nAcknowledging this gap, we advocate a paradigm shift toward identifying the\nunderlying mechanisms through which various small molecule drugs promote\ndifferentiation. Current studies have examined the downstream effects of FAK\nduring the differentiation process. Wrighton et al. revealed that\nextracellular signals modulate the autophosphorylation level at the\nintracellular FAK 397 site through integrin signaling, thereby regulating the\nactivation of the AKT pathway to balance the differentiation and self-renewal\nof embryonic stem cells [46]. Human FAK contains several tyrosine residues\nthat can be phosphorylated, including Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr576, Tyr577, and\nTyr925 [47]. Among these, Tyr397 is the most crucial phosphorylation site, the\nactivation of which can initiate downstream signaling. Tyr576 and Tyr577 are\nlocated within the kinase domain of FAK and serve as enhancers for the kinase\nactivity of FAK [48]. Phosphorylation of Y576/Y577 signifies full catalytical\nactivity of FAK [49]. Phosphorylated Y925 is a docking site for the adaptor\nprotein Grb2 [50], which links FAK signaling to the Ras/MAPK signaling\npathway. However, phosphorylated Y925 seems to have no direct relationship\nwith the tyrosine kinase activity of FAK. In summary, we believe that the\nphosphorylation status of the FAK Y397 site best represents the activation or\ninhibition of FAK kinase activity, while Y576/577 can serve as a supportive\nreference, and Y925 is not\n\n", "question": "What is the role of FAK in early developmental processes?", "answer": "FAK plays a pivotal role in early developmental processes, and its inhibition can induce early endocrine commitment.", "prompt": "Re-write the question to ask in greater depth.

Given that BCCT.core is the only established modality for\nevaluating aesthetic outcomes in postoperative breast cancer patients, it has\nbeen widely adopted in research, including recent prospective trials1\u20133. While\ndevelopers proposed adopting 3D images for future versions, no clear benefit\nwas outlined4. However, its reliability is in question due to discrepancies\nbetween patient self-assessments (69.2% to 74.8%) and clinician assessments\n(25% to 83%).5 Additionally, BCCT.core's applicability is limited for patients\nunderwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS). This limitation arises because the\nsoftware's objective indices are primarily designed for patients who have\nundergone breast-conserving surgery.\n\nGAN model is a recently emerging novel technique widely adopted in field of\nimaging due to its exceptionally plausible ability to detect abnormalities\nbetween normal images by deep learning.

While our previous\nstudy demonstrated excellent predictive capability and highlighted the\ndetrimental effects of RT on patients with tissue expanders compared to\nautologous reconstruction, it was limited to a single institution and focused\non patients with tissue expanders at the time of analysis.\n\nTherefore, to comprehensively evaluate the influence of RT on permanent\nimplants, we validated the applicability of the previously developed GAN\nmodel.

The generator is trained\nto produce realistic medical images from random noise, while the discriminator\nis trained to distinguish between real and generated images. After training,\nthe model identifies anomalies by comparing real images to generated ones,\nhighlighting discrepancies.

As\na nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, Src has been the subject of numerous\nstudies over three decades, in part, because of its association with malignant\ntransformation and oncogenesis [43]. SAR has been extensively studied and used\nfor cancer treatment; however, there have been no studies regarding its\napplication in the field of iPSC/ESC differentiation. In the present study, we\nfound for the first time that the Src inhibitor SAR exerts off-target effects\nto deactivate FAK under low concentration conditions, thereby promoting\nendodermal differentiation.\n\nNumerous studies have highlighted the pivotal role of FAK in early\ndevelopmental processes. For example, Afrikanova et al. demonstrated that the\nselective inhibition of FAK activation induces early endocrine commitment, as\nevidenced by an upregulation in the expression of key transcription factors,\nsuch as NGN3, NEUROD1, and NKX2.2 [44]. A parallel investigation by Liu et al.\ndemonstrated that 3D culture conditions play an important role in promoting\nendocrine commitment, which is consistent with some of our results. They\ndemonstrated that this effect is mediated by the limitation of FAK-dependent\nactivation of the SMAD2/3 pathway. Moreover, the functional maturation of\ninsulin-producing cells was enhanced in 3D culture, a phenomenon attributed to\nthe upregulation of Connexin 36 expression [45]. Previous studies provide\ncompelling evidence supporting the notion that 3D culture hampers the\nactivation of FAK, ultimately fostering commitment to the endocrine lineage\n[45]. These studies support the main findings of our study. Nonetheless, we\ndid not explore the impact of SAR on intercellular communication in the\npresent study, which represents an intriguing avenue for future studies. While\ncurrent research on stem cell differentiation into organoids has primarily\nfocused on phenotypic analyses, mechanistic studies remain less comprehensive.\nAcknowledging this gap, we advocate a paradigm shift toward identifying the\nunderlying mechanisms through which various small molecule drugs promote\ndifferentiation. Current studies have examined the downstream effects of FAK\nduring the differentiation process. Wrighton et al. revealed that\nextracellular signals modulate the autophosphorylation level at the\nintracellular FAK 397 site through integrin signaling, thereby regulating the\nactivation of the AKT pathway to balance the differentiation and self-renewal\nof embryonic stem cells [46]. Human FAK contains several tyrosine residues\nthat can be phosphorylated, including Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr576, Tyr577, and\nTyr925 [47]. Among these, Tyr397 is the most crucial phosphorylation site, the\nactivation of which can initiate downstream signaling. Tyr576 and Tyr577 are\nlocated within the kinase domain of FAK and serve as enhancers for the kinase\nactivity of FAK [48]. Phosphorylation of Y576/Y577 signifies full catalytical\nactivity of FAK [49]. Phosphorylated Y925 is a docking site for the adaptor\nprotein Grb2 [50], which links FAK signaling to the Ras/MAPK signaling\npathway. However, phosphorylated Y925 seems to have no direct relationship\nwith the tyrosine kinase activity of FAK. In summary, we believe that the\nphosphorylation status of the FAK Y397 site best represents the activation or\ninhibition of FAK kinase activity, while Y576/577 can serve as a supportive\nreference, and Y925 is not\n\n", "question": "What is the role of FAK in early developmental processes?", "answer": "FAK plays a pivotal role in early developmental processes, and its inhibition can induce early endocrine commitment.", "prompt": "Re-write the question to ask in greater depth.

Specifically, images are categorized into four classes:\nNormal, Benign, In Situ Carcinoma, and Invasive Carcinoma (see Figure 1). The\nannotation process involved the assessment of each image by two medical\nexperts, with any disagreements resulting in the exclusion of the respective\nimage from the dataset. In total, the microscopy image dataset consisted of\n400 images, evenly distributed across the four classes, with each class\ncontaining 100 images. These images were stored in .tiff format and possessed\nspecific characteristics: a color model of red\u2013green\u2013blue (RGB), dimensions of\n2048 \u00d7 1536 pixels, and a pixel scale of 0.42 \u00b5m \u00d7 0.42 \u00b5m. Additionally, the\nmemory space required for each image ranged from 10 to 20 MB, approximately.\nNotably, the labeling of the dataset was image-wise, providing comprehensive\ninformation about the cancer type represented in each image. This meticulously\ncurated dataset served as a valuable resource for training and evaluating\nmachine learning models for breast cancer histopathology image analysis.\n\nThe BreakHis dataset consists of 9109 microscopic images of breast tumor\ntissue. These images were collected from 82 patients and captured at various\nmagnification factors (40\u00d7, 100\u00d7, 200\u00d7, and 400\u00d7).

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation.

Physical barriers like the tumor stroma additionally prevent tumor\npenetration and limit the use of CAR-T cell treatment. The extracellular\nmatrix makes up the stroma and contains heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG),\nwhich CAR-T cells must knock down in order to infiltrate the tumor.\nHeparinase, an enzyme that breaks down heparin sulfate proteoglycan, has been\nadded to CAR-T cells, increasing their anticancer activity and tumor invasion.\nSimilarly, in animal models, CAR-T cells that specifically target the\nfibroblast activation protein (FAP) exhibit improved cytotoxic efficacy by\nreducing tumor fibroblasts. However, more research is needed to develop new\ndelivery techniques to extend therapeutic efficacy to complicated solid tumors\n[162].\n\n10.4. Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5. Toxicities Associated with CAR-T Cells\n\nCAR-T cell therapy has presented promising results in some tumors, but it is\nalso associated with substantial side effects that limit its usage as a first-\nline treatment.

Materials and Methods2.1. Dataset and Implementation Details\n\nThe BACH dataset utilized in this study comprises hematoxylin and eosin\n(H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images and whole-slide images.\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images were\nvaluable in this study because they provided detailed visual information\nregarding the cellular structure, morphology, and spatial distribution of\ntissues within the breast, aiding in the interpretation of pathological\nfeatures relevant to breast cancer research.\n\nIn the BACH dataset, we focused on the microscopy images, which are\nmeticulously labeled by medical experts based on the predominant cancer type\npresent in each image. Specifically, images are categorized into four classes:\nNormal, Benign, In Situ Carcinoma, and Invasive Carcinoma (see Figure 1). The\nannotation process involved the assessment of each image by two medical\nexperts, with any disagreements resulting in the exclusion of the respective\nimage from the dataset. In total, the microscopy image dataset consisted of\n400 images, evenly distributed across the four classes, with each class\ncontaining 100 images. These images were stored in .tiff format and possessed\nspecific characteristics: a color model of red\u2013green\u2013blue (RGB), dimensions of\n2048 \u00d7 1536 pixels, and a pixel scale of 0.42 \u00b5m \u00d7 0.42 \u00b5m. Additionally, the\nmemory space required for each image ranged from 10 to 20 MB, approximately.\nNotably, the labeling of the dataset was image-wise, providing comprehensive\ninformation about the cancer type represented in each image. This meticulously\ncurated dataset served as a valuable resource for training and evaluating\nmachine learning models for breast cancer histopathology image analysis.\n\nThe BreakHis dataset consists of 9109 microscopic images of breast tumor\ntissue.

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al.

Materials and Methods2.1. Dataset and Implementation Details\n\nThe BACH dataset utilized in this study comprises hematoxylin and eosin\n(H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images and whole-slide images.\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images were\nvaluable in this study because they provided detailed visual information\nregarding the cellular structure, morphology, and spatial distribution of\ntissues within the breast, aiding in the interpretation of pathological\nfeatures relevant to breast cancer research.\n\nIn the BACH dataset, we focused on the microscopy images, which are\nmeticulously labeled by medical experts based on the predominant cancer type\npresent in each image. Specifically, images are categorized into four classes:\nNormal, Benign, In Situ Carcinoma, and Invasive Carcinoma (see Figure 1). The\nannotation process involved the assessment of each image by two medical\nexperts, with any disagreements resulting in the exclusion of the respective\nimage from the dataset. In total, the microscopy image dataset consisted of\n400 images, evenly distributed across the four classes, with each class\ncontaining 100 images. These images were stored in .tiff format and possessed\nspecific characteristics: a color model of red\u2013green\u2013blue (RGB), dimensions of\n2048 \u00d7 1536 pixels, and a pixel scale of 0.42 \u00b5m \u00d7 0.42 \u00b5m. Additionally, the\nmemory space required for each image ranged from 10 to 20 MB, approximately.\nNotably, the labeling of the dataset was image-wise, providing comprehensive\ninformation about the cancer type represented in each image. This meticulously\ncurated dataset served as a valuable resource for training and evaluating\nmachine learning models for breast cancer histopathology image analysis.\n\nThe BreakHis dataset consists of 9109 microscopic images of breast tumor\ntissue. These images were collected from 82 patients and captured at various\nmagnification factors (40\u00d7, 100\u00d7, 200\u00d7, and 400\u00d7). The dataset includes 2480\nbenign and 5429 malignant samples. Each sample is a 700 \u00d7 460 pixel, 3-channel\nRGB image with an 8-bit depth in each channel, stored in PNG format. The\ndataset categorizes tumors into benign and malignant classes, each with\nseveral subclasses. For benign tumors, these subclasses include Adenosis,\nFibroadenoma, Tubular adenoma, and Phyllodes adenoma. For malignant tumors,\nthe subclasses include Ductal carcinoma, Lobular carcinoma, Mucinous\ncarcinoma, and Papillary carcinoma.

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al. [140] looked at the co-\neffects of sulforaphane and metformin on MCF-10A, MCF-7, and BT-474 cells.\nAlthough each compound has its own impact on cell\n\n", "question": "What is the major target of sulforaphane?", "answer": "Nrf2, a transcription factor that regulates antioxidant and cytoprotective enzymes.", "prompt": "Re-write the question such that its answer is not general and appropriately states exceptions and conditions to demonstrate a deep and nuanced understanding of the question."}

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al.

Other recent work has identified a TCR mimic\nantibody that targets NRASQ61R and HLA-A*01:01, underscoring the interest in\nthat neoantigen as an immunotherapeutic target (19).\n\nMcShan et al.

Interestingly, AlphaFold\ngenerated accurate models of both N17.1.2 complexes, but accuracy depended on\nAlphaFold implementation and the number of models produced, whereas it did not\ngenerate high scoring models for the other complexes modeled.

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al.

Physical barriers like the tumor stroma additionally prevent tumor\npenetration and limit the use of CAR-T cell treatment. The extracellular\nmatrix makes up the stroma and contains heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG),\nwhich CAR-T cells must knock down in order to infiltrate the tumor.\nHeparinase, an enzyme that breaks down heparin sulfate proteoglycan, has been\nadded to CAR-T cells, increasing their anticancer activity and tumor invasion.\nSimilarly, in animal models, CAR-T cells that specifically target the\nfibroblast activation protein (FAP) exhibit improved cytotoxic efficacy by\nreducing tumor fibroblasts. However, more research is needed to develop new\ndelivery techniques to extend therapeutic efficacy to complicated solid tumors\n[162].\n\n10.4. Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5. Toxicities Associated with CAR-T Cells\n\nCAR-T cell therapy has presented promising results in some tumors, but it is\nalso associated with substantial side effects that limit its usage as a first-\nline treatment.

Materials and Methods2.1. Dataset and Implementation Details\n\nThe BACH dataset utilized in this study comprises hematoxylin and eosin\n(H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images and whole-slide images.\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images were\nvaluable in this study because they provided detailed visual information\nregarding the cellular structure, morphology, and spatial distribution of\ntissues within the breast, aiding in the interpretation of pathological\nfeatures relevant to breast cancer research.\n\nIn the BACH dataset, we focused on the microscopy images, which are\nmeticulously labeled by medical experts based on the predominant cancer type\npresent in each image. Specifically, images are categorized into four classes:\nNormal, Benign, In Situ Carcinoma, and Invasive Carcinoma (see Figure 1). The\nannotation process involved the assessment of each image by two medical\nexperts, with any disagreements resulting in the exclusion of the respective\nimage from the dataset. In total, the microscopy image dataset consisted of\n400 images, evenly distributed across the four classes, with each class\ncontaining 100 images. These images were stored in .tiff format and possessed\nspecific characteristics: a color model of red\u2013green\u2013blue (RGB), dimensions of\n2048 \u00d7 1536 pixels, and a pixel scale of 0.42 \u00b5m \u00d7 0.42 \u00b5m. Additionally, the\nmemory space required for each image ranged from 10 to 20 MB, approximately.\nNotably, the labeling of the dataset was image-wise, providing comprehensive\ninformation about the cancer type represented in each image. This meticulously\ncurated dataset served as a valuable resource for training and evaluating\nmachine learning models for breast cancer histopathology image analysis.\n\nThe BreakHis dataset consists of 9109 microscopic images of breast tumor\ntissue. These images were collected from 82 patients and captured at various\nmagnification factors (40\u00d7, 100\u00d7, 200\u00d7, and 400\u00d7).

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al.

Physical barriers like the tumor stroma additionally prevent tumor\npenetration and limit the use of CAR-T cell treatment. The extracellular\nmatrix makes up the stroma and contains heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG),\nwhich CAR-T cells must knock down in order to infiltrate the tumor.\nHeparinase, an enzyme that breaks down heparin sulfate proteoglycan, has been\nadded to CAR-T cells, increasing their anticancer activity and tumor invasion.\nSimilarly, in animal models, CAR-T cells that specifically target the\nfibroblast activation protein (FAP) exhibit improved cytotoxic efficacy by\nreducing tumor fibroblasts. However, more research is needed to develop new\ndelivery techniques to extend therapeutic efficacy to complicated solid tumors\n[162].\n\n10.4. Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5. Toxicities Associated with CAR-T Cells\n\nCAR-T cell therapy has presented promising results in some tumors, but it is\nalso associated with substantial side effects that limit its usage as a first-\nline treatment.

Materials and Methods2.1. Dataset and Implementation Details\n\nThe BACH dataset utilized in this study comprises hematoxylin and eosin\n(H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images and whole-slide images.\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images were\nvaluable in this study because they provided detailed visual information\nregarding the cellular structure, morphology, and spatial distribution of\ntissues within the breast, aiding in the interpretation of pathological\nfeatures relevant to breast cancer research.\n\nIn the BACH dataset, we focused on the microscopy images, which are\nmeticulously labeled by medical experts based on the predominant cancer type\npresent in each image. Specifically, images are categorized into four classes:\nNormal, Benign, In Situ Carcinoma, and Invasive Carcinoma (see Figure 1). The\nannotation process involved the assessment of each image by two medical\nexperts, with any disagreements resulting in the exclusion of the respective\nimage from the dataset. In total, the microscopy image dataset consisted of\n400 images, evenly distributed across the four classes, with each class\ncontaining 100 images. These images were stored in .tiff format and possessed\nspecific characteristics: a color model of red\u2013green\u2013blue (RGB), dimensions of\n2048 \u00d7 1536 pixels, and a pixel scale of 0.42 \u00b5m \u00d7 0.42 \u00b5m. Additionally, the\nmemory space required for each image ranged from 10 to 20 MB, approximately.\nNotably, the labeling of the dataset was image-wise, providing comprehensive\ninformation about the cancer type represented in each image. This meticulously\ncurated dataset served as a valuable resource for training and evaluating\nmachine learning models for breast cancer histopathology image analysis.\n\nThe BreakHis dataset consists of 9109 microscopic images of breast tumor\ntissue. These images were collected from 82 patients and captured at various\nmagnification factors (40\u00d7, 100\u00d7, 200\u00d7, and 400\u00d7). The dataset includes 2480\nbenign and 5429 malignant samples. Each sample is a 700 \u00d7 460 pixel, 3-channel\nRGB image with an 8-bit depth in each channel, stored in PNG format. The\ndataset categorizes tumors into benign and malignant classes, each with\nseveral subclasses.

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al.

Physical barriers like the tumor stroma additionally prevent tumor\npenetration and limit the use of CAR-T cell treatment. The extracellular\nmatrix makes up the stroma and contains heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG),\nwhich CAR-T cells must knock down in order to infiltrate the tumor.\nHeparinase, an enzyme that breaks down heparin sulfate proteoglycan, has been\nadded to CAR-T cells, increasing their anticancer activity and tumor invasion.\nSimilarly, in animal models, CAR-T cells that specifically target the\nfibroblast activation protein (FAP) exhibit improved cytotoxic efficacy by\nreducing tumor fibroblasts. However, more research is needed to develop new\ndelivery techniques to extend therapeutic efficacy to complicated solid tumors\n[162].\n\n10.4. Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5.

Physical barriers like the tumor stroma additionally prevent tumor\npenetration and limit the use of CAR-T cell treatment. The extracellular\nmatrix makes up the stroma and contains heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG),\nwhich CAR-T cells must knock down in order to infiltrate the tumor.\nHeparinase, an enzyme that breaks down heparin sulfate proteoglycan, has been\nadded to CAR-T cells, increasing their anticancer activity and tumor invasion.\nSimilarly, in animal models, CAR-T cells that specifically target the\nfibroblast activation protein (FAP) exhibit improved cytotoxic efficacy by\nreducing tumor fibroblasts. However, more research is needed to develop new\ndelivery techniques to extend therapeutic efficacy to complicated solid tumors\n[162].\n\n10.4. Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5.

Materials and Methods2.1. Dataset and Implementation Details\n\nThe BACH dataset utilized in this study comprises hematoxylin and eosin\n(H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images and whole-slide images.\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images were\nvaluable in this study because they provided detailed visual information\nregarding the cellular structure, morphology, and spatial distribution of\ntissues within the breast, aiding in the interpretation of pathological\nfeatures relevant to breast cancer research.\n\nIn the BACH dataset, we focused on the microscopy images, which are\nmeticulously labeled by medical experts based on the predominant cancer type\npresent in each image. Specifically, images are categorized into four classes:\nNormal, Benign, In Situ Carcinoma, and Invasive Carcinoma (see Figure 1). The\nannotation process involved the assessment of each image by two medical\nexperts, with any disagreements resulting in the exclusion of the respective\nimage from the dataset. In total, the microscopy image dataset consisted of\n400 images, evenly distributed across the four classes, with each class\ncontaining 100 images. These images were stored in .tiff format and possessed\nspecific characteristics: a color model of red\u2013green\u2013blue (RGB), dimensions of\n2048 \u00d7 1536 pixels, and a pixel scale of 0.42 \u00b5m \u00d7 0.42 \u00b5m. Additionally, the\nmemory space required for each image ranged from 10 to 20 MB, approximately.\nNotably, the labeling of the dataset was image-wise, providing comprehensive\ninformation about the cancer type represented in each image. This meticulously\ncurated dataset served as a valuable resource for training and evaluating\nmachine learning models for breast cancer histopathology image analysis.\n\nThe BreakHis dataset consists of 9109 microscopic images of breast tumor\ntissue.

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al.

Interestingly, AlphaFold\ngenerated accurate models of both N17.1.2 complexes, but accuracy depended on\nAlphaFold implementation and the number of models produced, whereas it did not\ngenerate high scoring models for the other complexes modeled. These findings\nestablish the structural basis for T cell recognition of NRASQ61 neoantigens,\nand provide valuable insights into the accuracy and limitations of AlphaFold\nin a challenging predictive modeling scenario.\n\nResultsTCR N17.1.2 Discriminates between Mutant and Wild-type NRAS Peptides.\n\nTCR N17.1.2 was isolated by screening TILs from melanoma patients for\nreactivity towards the mutated NRASQ61K neoantigen (15).

{"question_new": "What specific molecular mechanisms underlie the cytotoxic effects of Kaempferol against breast cancer cells, and how do these mechanisms interact to inhibit cancer cell growth and proliferation?", "answer_new": "Kaempferol's cytotoxic effects against breast cancer cells involve multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of glucose uptake, induction of the mitochondrial caspase-9 pathway, activation of PARP, blockade of PKC/MAPK/AP-1 signaling, and inhibition of MMP expression and activity. Additionally, Kaempferol's antioxidant action may also contribute to its anti-cancer effects by inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reversing the cell phenotype of malignant cancers. These mechanisms interact to inhibit cancer cell growth and proliferation, highlighting Kaempferol's potential as a therapeutic agent in breast cancer treatment.", "id": "PMC11172642-35", "context": "activity. Physical barriers like the tumor stroma additionally prevent tumor\npenetration and limit the use of CAR-T cell treatment. The extracellular\nmatrix makes up the stroma and contains heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG),\nwhich CAR-T cells must knock down in order to infiltrate the tumor.\nHeparinase, an enzyme that breaks down heparin sulfate proteoglycan, has been\nadded to CAR-T cells, increasing their anticancer activity and tumor invasion.\nSimilarly, in animal models, CAR-T cells that specifically target the\nfibroblast activation protein (FAP) exhibit improved cytotoxic efficacy by\nreducing tumor fibroblasts. However, more research is needed to develop new\ndelivery techniques to extend therapeutic efficacy to complicated solid tumors\n[162].\n\n10.4. Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5. Toxicities Associated with CAR-T Cells\n\nCAR-T cell therapy has presented promising results in some tumors, but it is\nalso associated with substantial side effects that limit its usage as a first-\nline treatment. The type of cancer, the target antigen, and the CAR design\ninfluence the risk and severity of two major toxicities: hemophagocytic\nlymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

Physical barriers like the tumor stroma additionally prevent tumor\npenetration and limit the use of CAR-T cell treatment.

However, more research is needed to develop new\ndelivery techniques to extend therapeutic efficacy to complicated solid tumors\n[162].\n\n10.4. Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration.

Specifically, images are categorized into four classes:\nNormal, Benign, In Situ Carcinoma, and Invasive Carcinoma (see Figure 1). The\nannotation process involved the assessment of each image by two medical\nexperts, with any disagreements resulting in the exclusion of the respective\nimage from the dataset. In total, the microscopy image dataset consisted of\n400 images, evenly distributed across the four classes, with each class\ncontaining 100 images.

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al.

Physical barriers like the tumor stroma additionally prevent tumor\npenetration and limit the use of CAR-T cell treatment. The extracellular\nmatrix makes up the stroma and contains heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG),\nwhich CAR-T cells must knock down in order to infiltrate the tumor.\nHeparinase, an enzyme that breaks down heparin sulfate proteoglycan, has been\nadded to CAR-T cells, increasing their anticancer activity and tumor invasion.\nSimilarly, in animal models, CAR-T cells that specifically target the\nfibroblast activation protein (FAP) exhibit improved cytotoxic efficacy by\nreducing tumor fibroblasts.

These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration.

Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al.

Physical barriers like the tumor stroma additionally prevent tumor\npenetration and limit the use of CAR-T cell treatment. The extracellular\nmatrix makes up the stroma and contains heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG),\nwhich CAR-T cells must knock down in order to infiltrate the tumor.\nHeparinase, an enzyme that breaks down heparin sulfate proteoglycan, has been\nadded to CAR-T cells, increasing their anticancer activity and tumor invasion.\nSimilarly, in animal models, CAR-T cells that specifically target the\nfibroblast activation protein (FAP) exhibit improved cytotoxic efficacy by\nreducing tumor fibroblasts. However, more research is needed to develop new\ndelivery techniques to extend therapeutic efficacy to complicated solid tumors\n[162].\n\n10.4. Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5. Toxicities Associated with CAR-T Cells\n\nCAR-T cell therapy has presented promising results in some tumors, but it is\nalso associated with substantial side effects that limit its usage as a first-\nline treatment. The type of cancer, the target antigen, and the CAR design\ninfluence the risk and severity of two major toxicities: hemophagocytic\nlymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al. [140] looked at the co-\neffects of sulforaphane and metformin on MCF-10A, MCF-7, and BT-474 cells.\nAlthough each compound has its own impact on cell\n\n", "question": "What is the major target of sulforaphane?", "answer": "Nrf2, a transcription factor that regulates antioxidant and cytoprotective enzymes.", "prompt": "Re-write the question such that its answer is not general and appropriately states exceptions and conditions to demonstrate a deep and nuanced understanding of the question."}

Physical barriers like the tumor stroma additionally prevent tumor\npenetration and limit the use of CAR-T cell treatment. The extracellular\nmatrix makes up the stroma and contains heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG),\nwhich CAR-T cells must knock down in order to infiltrate the tumor.\nHeparinase, an enzyme that breaks down heparin sulfate proteoglycan, has been\nadded to CAR-T cells, increasing their anticancer activity and tumor invasion.\nSimilarly, in animal models, CAR-T cells that specifically target the\nfibroblast activation protein (FAP) exhibit improved cytotoxic efficacy by\nreducing tumor fibroblasts. However, more research is needed to develop new\ndelivery techniques to extend therapeutic efficacy to complicated solid tumors\n[162].\n\n10.4. Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5. Toxicities Associated with CAR-T Cells\n\nCAR-T cell therapy has presented promising results in some tumors, but it is\nalso associated with substantial side effects that limit its usage as a first-\nline treatment.

Specifically, images are categorized into four classes:\nNormal, Benign, In Situ Carcinoma, and Invasive Carcinoma (see Figure 1). The\nannotation process involved the assessment of each image by two medical\nexperts, with any disagreements resulting in the exclusion of the respective\nimage from the dataset. In total, the microscopy image dataset consisted of\n400 images, evenly distributed across the four classes, with each class\ncontaining 100 images.

The extracellular\nmatrix makes up the stroma and contains heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG),\nwhich CAR-T cells must knock down in order to infiltrate the tumor.\nHeparinase, an enzyme that breaks down heparin sulfate proteoglycan, has been\nadded to CAR-T cells, increasing their anticancer activity and tumor invasion.\nSimilarly, in animal models, CAR-T cells that specifically target the\nfibroblast activation protein (FAP) exhibit improved cytotoxic efficacy by\nreducing tumor fibroblasts. However, more research is needed to develop new\ndelivery techniques to extend therapeutic efficacy to complicated solid tumors\n[162].\n\n10.4. Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5. Toxicities Associated with CAR-T Cells\n\nCAR-T cell therapy has presented promising results in some tumors, but it is\nalso associated with substantial side effects that limit its usage as a first-\nline treatment.

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment.

Physical barriers like the tumor stroma additionally prevent tumor\npenetration and limit the use of CAR-T cell treatment. The extracellular\nmatrix makes up the stroma and contains heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG),\nwhich CAR-T cells must knock down in order to infiltrate the tumor.\nHeparinase, an enzyme that breaks down heparin sulfate proteoglycan, has been\nadded to CAR-T cells, increasing their anticancer activity and tumor invasion.\nSimilarly, in animal models, CAR-T cells that specifically target the\nfibroblast activation protein (FAP) exhibit improved cytotoxic efficacy by\nreducing tumor fibroblasts. However, more research is needed to develop new\ndelivery techniques to extend therapeutic efficacy to complicated solid tumors\n[162].\n\n10.4. Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5. Toxicities Associated with CAR-T Cells\n\nCAR-T cell therapy has presented promising results in some tumors, but it is\nalso associated with substantial side effects that limit its usage as a first-\nline treatment.

Materials and Methods2.1. Dataset and Implementation Details\n\nThe BACH dataset utilized in this study comprises hematoxylin and eosin\n(H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images and whole-slide images.\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images were\nvaluable in this study because they provided detailed visual information\nregarding the cellular structure, morphology, and spatial distribution of\ntissues within the breast, aiding in the interpretation of pathological\nfeatures relevant to breast cancer research.\n\nIn the BACH dataset, we focused on the microscopy images, which are\nmeticulously labeled by medical experts based on the predominant cancer type\npresent in each image. Specifically, images are categorized into four classes:\nNormal, Benign, In Situ Carcinoma, and Invasive Carcinoma (see Figure 1). The\nannotation process involved the assessment of each image by two medical\nexperts, with any disagreements resulting in the exclusion of the respective\nimage from the dataset. In total, the microscopy image dataset consisted of\n400 images, evenly distributed across the four classes, with each class\ncontaining 100 images. These images were stored in .tiff format and possessed\nspecific characteristics: a color model of red\u2013green\u2013blue (RGB), dimensions of\n2048 \u00d7 1536 pixels, and a pixel scale of 0.42 \u00b5m \u00d7 0.42 \u00b5m. Additionally, the\nmemory space required for each image ranged from 10 to 20 MB, approximately.\nNotably, the labeling of the dataset was image-wise, providing comprehensive\ninformation about the cancer type represented in each image. This meticulously\ncurated dataset served as a valuable resource for training and evaluating\nmachine learning models for breast cancer histopathology image analysis.\n\nThe BreakHis dataset consists of 9109 microscopic images of breast tumor\ntissue.

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al.

{"answer_new": "Epigenetic remodeling influences the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) by enabling cancer cells to rapidly adapt to selective pressures through changes in their epigenetic state. This adaptation allows cancer cells to activate alternative gene regulatory programs, including those that modulate T cell immunity. However, the effectiveness of this process can vary significantly across different cancer types and stages, as well as in response to specific epigenetic therapies. The interplay between epigenetic changes in cancer cells and the TME can result in the recruitment of tumor-associated myeloid cells, which contribute to an immunosuppressive environment that hinders cytotoxic T cell function.

In total, the microscopy image dataset consisted of\n400 images, evenly distributed across the four classes, with each class\ncontaining 100 images.

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al.

These\noligoclonal TCRs, transduced into a patient\u2019s peripheral blood lymphocytes for\nACT, may prove effective in eliminating tumors expressing HLA-A*01:01 and the\nNRASQ61K or NRASQ61R mutation. Other recent work has identified a TCR mimic\nantibody that targets NRASQ61R and HLA-A*01:01, underscoring the interest in\nthat neoantigen as an immunotherapeutic target (19).\n\nMcShan et al. (20) recently determined the solution structure of the\nNRASQ61K\u2013HLA-A*01:01 complex by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and used\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations to probe the conformational dynamics of\nthe MHC-bound NRASQ61K peptide. This study showed that the side chains of T58,\nK61, and E63 form an exposed molecular surface, whereas those of I55, L56, and\nY64 are buried in the peptide-binding groove of HLA-A*01:01. However,\nunderstanding how TCRs discriminate between wild-type and mutated NRAS\nrequires knowing the structure of TCR\u2013peptide\u2013MHC (TCR\u2013pMHC) complexes (21).\nHere we report crystal structures of a TCR (N17.1.2) from a melanoma patient\nthat recognizes both NRASQ61K and NRASQ61R neoepitopes (15) in complex with\nNRASQ61K\u2013HLA-A*01 and NRASQ61R\u2013HLA-A*01, as well as the structure of the\nunbound TCR.\n\nThe deep learning method AlphaFold (22) has shown impressive performance in\npredictive modeling (23) and has been adapted and tested for modeling TCR\u2013pMHC\ncomplex structures (24, 25), which as noted recently can potentially be\nutilized for large-scale T cell specificity prediction (26). Given that immune\nrecognition (including TCR\u2013pMHC recognition) is generally not as accurately\nmodeled as other protein complexes by AlphaFold (27), and that others have\nnoted concerns about AlphaFold\u2019s accuracy and utility in some scenarios (28),\nwe tested the capability of AlphaFold to model TCR N17.1.2 in complex with its\nneoantigen targets, and also tested it for predictive modeling of complexes\nfor other TCRs known to bind NRASQ61K\u2013HLA-A*01.

Physical barriers like the tumor stroma additionally prevent tumor\npenetration and limit the use of CAR-T cell treatment. The extracellular\nmatrix makes up the stroma and contains heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG),\nwhich CAR-T cells must knock down in order to infiltrate the tumor.\nHeparinase, an enzyme that breaks down heparin sulfate proteoglycan, has been\nadded to CAR-T cells, increasing their anticancer activity and tumor invasion.\nSimilarly, in animal models, CAR-T cells that specifically target the\nfibroblast activation protein (FAP) exhibit improved cytotoxic efficacy by\nreducing tumor fibroblasts. However, more research is needed to develop new\ndelivery techniques to extend therapeutic efficacy to complicated solid tumors\n[162].\n\n10.4. Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5. Toxicities Associated with CAR-T Cells\n\nCAR-T cell therapy has presented promising results in some tumors, but it is\nalso associated with substantial side effects that limit its usage as a first-\nline treatment. The type of cancer, the target antigen, and the CAR design\ninfluence the risk and severity of two major toxicities: hemophagocytic\nlymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

Physical barriers like the tumor stroma additionally prevent tumor\npenetration and limit the use of CAR-T cell treatment. The extracellular\nmatrix makes up the stroma and contains heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG),\nwhich CAR-T cells must knock down in order to infiltrate the tumor.\nHeparinase, an enzyme that breaks down heparin sulfate proteoglycan, has been\nadded to CAR-T cells, increasing their anticancer activity and tumor invasion.\nSimilarly, in animal models, CAR-T cells that specifically target the\nfibroblast activation protein (FAP) exhibit improved cytotoxic efficacy by\nreducing tumor fibroblasts. However, more research is needed to develop new\ndelivery techniques to extend therapeutic efficacy to complicated solid tumors\n[162].\n\n10.4. Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5.

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al.

Specifically, images are categorized into four classes:\nNormal, Benign, In Situ Carcinoma, and Invasive Carcinoma (see Figure 1). The\nannotation process involved the assessment of each image by two medical\nexperts, with any disagreements resulting in the exclusion of the respective\nimage from the dataset. In total, the microscopy image dataset consisted of\n400 images, evenly distributed across the four classes, with each class\ncontaining 100 images. These images were stored in .tiff format and possessed\nspecific characteristics: a color model of red\u2013green\u2013blue (RGB), dimensions of\n2048 \u00d7 1536 pixels, and a pixel scale of 0.42 \u00b5m \u00d7 0.42 \u00b5m. Additionally, the\nmemory space required for each image ranged from 10 to 20 MB, approximately.\nNotably, the labeling of the dataset was image-wise, providing comprehensive\ninformation about the cancer type represented in each image. This meticulously\ncurated dataset served as a valuable resource for training and evaluating\nmachine learning models for breast cancer histopathology image analysis.\n\nThe BreakHis dataset consists of 9109 microscopic images of breast tumor\ntissue.

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells.

Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB.

Physical barriers like the tumor stroma additionally prevent tumor\npenetration and limit the use of CAR-T cell treatment. The extracellular\nmatrix makes up the stroma and contains heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG),\nwhich CAR-T cells must knock down in order to infiltrate the tumor.\nHeparinase, an enzyme that breaks down heparin sulfate proteoglycan, has been\nadded to CAR-T cells, increasing their anticancer activity and tumor invasion.\nSimilarly, in animal models, CAR-T cells that specifically target the\nfibroblast activation protein (FAP) exhibit improved cytotoxic efficacy by\nreducing tumor fibroblasts. However, more research is needed to develop new\ndelivery techniques to extend therapeutic efficacy to complicated solid tumors\n[162].\n\n10.4. Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5.

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138].

These\noligoclonal TCRs, transduced into a patient\u2019s peripheral blood lymphocytes for\nACT, may prove effective in eliminating tumors expressing HLA-A*01:01 and the\nNRASQ61K or NRASQ61R mutation. Other recent work has identified a TCR mimic\nantibody that targets NRASQ61R and HLA-A*01:01, underscoring the interest in\nthat neoantigen as an immunotherapeutic target (19).\n\nMcShan et al.

This study showed that the side chains of T58,\nK61, and E63 form an exposed molecular surface, whereas those of I55, L56, and\nY64 are buried in the peptide-binding groove of HLA-A*01:01. However,\nunderstanding how TCRs discriminate between wild-type and mutated NRAS\nrequires knowing the structure of TCR\u2013peptide\u2013MHC (TCR\u2013pMHC) complexes (21).\nHere we report crystal structures of a TCR (N17.1.2) from a melanoma patient\nthat recognizes both NRASQ61K and NRASQ61R neoepitopes (15) in complex with\nNRASQ61K\u2013HLA-A*01 and NRASQ61R\u2013HLA-A*01, as well as the structure of the\nunbound TCR.\n\nThe deep learning method AlphaFold (22) has shown impressive performance in\npredictive modeling (23) and has been adapted and tested for modeling TCR\u2013pMHC\ncomplex structures (24, 25), which as noted recently can potentially be\nutilized for large-scale T cell specificity prediction (26). Given that immune\nrecognition (including TCR\u2013pMHC recognition) is generally not as accurately\nmodeled as other protein complexes by AlphaFold (27), and that others have\nnoted concerns about AlphaFold\u2019s accuracy and utility in some scenarios (28),\nwe tested the capability of AlphaFold to model TCR N17.1.2 in complex with its\nneoantigen targets, and also tested it for predictive modeling of complexes\nfor other TCRs known to bind NRASQ61K\u2013HLA-A*01. Interestingly, AlphaFold\ngenerated accurate models of both N17.1.2 complexes, but accuracy depended on\nAlphaFold implementation and the number of models produced, whereas it did not\ngenerate high scoring models for the other complexes modeled.

Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5. Toxicities Associated with CAR-T Cells\n\nCAR-T cell therapy has presented promising results in some tumors, but it is\nalso associated with substantial side effects that limit its usage as a first-\nline treatment. The type of cancer, the target antigen, and the CAR design\ninfluence the risk and severity of two major toxicities: hemophagocytic\nlymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

Physical barriers like the tumor stroma additionally prevent tumor\npenetration and limit the use of CAR-T cell treatment. The extracellular\nmatrix makes up the stroma and contains heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG),\nwhich CAR-T cells must knock down in order to infiltrate the tumor.\nHeparinase, an enzyme that breaks down heparin sulfate proteoglycan, has been\nadded to CAR-T cells, increasing their anticancer activity and tumor invasion.\nSimilarly, in animal models, CAR-T cells that specifically target the\nfibroblast activation protein (FAP) exhibit improved cytotoxic efficacy by\nreducing tumor fibroblasts. However, more research is needed to develop new\ndelivery techniques to extend therapeutic efficacy to complicated solid tumors\n[162].\n\n10.4. Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5. Toxicities Associated with CAR-T Cells\n\nCAR-T cell therapy has presented promising results in some tumors, but it is\nalso associated with substantial side effects that limit its usage as a first-\nline treatment.

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al.

{"question_new": "What specific molecular mechanisms does CANT1 employ to regulate RB progression, and in which contexts might its regulatory effects be most pronounced?", "answer_new": "CANT1 primarily regulates RB progression by inhibiting histone H3K4 trimethylation at the promoter region of PI3K\u03b3, thus effectively suppressing PI3K\u03b3 expression. This regulatory effect is notably observed in the context of uveal melanoma, where CANT1 also modulates the transcription of essential tumor suppressors by promoting H3K4 methylation in their promoters, suggesting its potential as a common therapeutic target across various cancers.", "id": "PMC11206589-12", "context": "id=\"sec5dot1-nutrients-16-01883\">5.1. Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al. [140] looked at the co-\neffects of sulforaphane and metformin on MCF-10A, MCF-7, and BT-474 cells.\nAlthough each compound has its own impact on cell\n\n", "question": "What is the major target of sulforaphane?", "answer": "Nrf2, a transcription factor that regulates antioxidant and cytoprotective enzymes.", "prompt": "Re-write the question such that its answer is not general and appropriately states exceptions and conditions to demonstrate a deep and nuanced understanding of the question."}
{"answer_new": "Senescence has a dual effect in cancer, with both tumor-suppressive and oncogenic impacts. While it can act as a tumor-suppressive mechanism through cell cycle arrest, it can also promote tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).

Physical barriers like the tumor stroma additionally prevent tumor\npenetration and limit the use of CAR-T cell treatment.

However, more research is needed to develop new\ndelivery techniques to extend therapeutic efficacy to complicated solid tumors\n[162].\n\n10.4. Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5.

Dataset and Implementation Details\n\nThe BACH dataset utilized in this study comprises hematoxylin and eosin\n(H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images and whole-slide images.\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images were\nvaluable in this study because they provided detailed visual information\nregarding the cellular structure, morphology, and spatial distribution of\ntissues within the breast, aiding in the interpretation of pathological\nfeatures relevant to breast cancer research.\n\nIn the BACH dataset, we focused on the microscopy images, which are\nmeticulously labeled by medical experts based on the predominant cancer type\npresent in each image. Specifically, images are categorized into four classes:\nNormal, Benign, In Situ Carcinoma, and Invasive Carcinoma (see Figure 1). The\nannotation process involved the assessment of each image by two medical\nexperts, with any disagreements resulting in the exclusion of the respective\nimage from the dataset. In total, the microscopy image dataset consisted of\n400 images, evenly distributed across the four classes, with each class\ncontaining 100 images. These images were stored in .tiff format and possessed\nspecific characteristics: a color model of red\u2013green\u2013blue (RGB), dimensions of\n2048 \u00d7 1536 pixels, and a pixel scale of 0.42 \u00b5m \u00d7 0.42 \u00b5m. Additionally, the\nmemory space required for each image ranged from 10 to 20 MB, approximately.\nNotably, the labeling of the dataset was image-wise, providing comprehensive\ninformation about the cancer type represented in each image. This meticulously\ncurated dataset served as a valuable resource for training and evaluating\nmachine learning models for breast cancer histopathology image analysis.\n\nThe BreakHis dataset consists of 9109 microscopic images of breast tumor\ntissue. These images were collected from 82 patients and captured at various\nmagnification factors (40\u00d7, 100\u00d7, 200\u00d7, and 400\u00d7). The dataset includes 2480\nbenign and 5429 malignant samples. Each sample is a 700 \u00d7 460 pixel, 3-channel\nRGB image with an 8-bit depth in each channel, stored in PNG format. The\ndataset categorizes tumors into benign and malignant classes, each with\nseveral subclasses. For benign tumors, these subclasses include Adenosis,\nFibroadenoma, Tubular adenoma, and Phyllodes adenoma. For malignant tumors,\nthe subclasses include Ductal carcinoma, Lobular carcinoma, Mucinous\ncarcinoma, and Papillary carcinoma.

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al.

The TCRs are\nrestricted by the prevalent MHC class I allele HLA-A*01:01 (15). These\noligoclonal TCRs, transduced into a patient\u2019s peripheral blood lymphocytes for\nACT, may prove effective in eliminating tumors expressing HLA-A*01:01 and the\nNRASQ61K or NRASQ61R mutation. Other recent work has identified a TCR mimic\nantibody that targets NRASQ61R and HLA-A*01:01, underscoring the interest in\nthat neoantigen as an immunotherapeutic target (19).\n\nMcShan et al. (20) recently determined the solution structure of the\nNRASQ61K\u2013HLA-A*01:01 complex by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and used\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations to probe the conformational dynamics of\nthe MHC-bound NRASQ61K peptide. This study showed that the side chains of T58,\nK61, and E63 form an exposed molecular surface, whereas those of I55, L56, and\nY64 are buried in the peptide-binding groove of HLA-A*01:01. However,\nunderstanding how TCRs discriminate between wild-type and mutated NRAS\nrequires knowing the structure of TCR\u2013peptide\u2013MHC (TCR\u2013pMHC) complexes (21).\nHere we report crystal structures of a TCR (N17.1.2) from a melanoma patient\nthat recognizes both NRASQ61K and NRASQ61R neoepitopes (15) in complex with\nNRASQ61K\u2013HLA-A*01 and NRASQ61R\u2013HLA-A*01, as well as the structure of the\nunbound TCR.\n\nThe deep learning method AlphaFold (22) has shown impressive performance in\npredictive modeling (23) and has been adapted and tested for modeling TCR\u2013pMHC\ncomplex structures (24, 25), which as noted recently can potentially be\nutilized for large-scale T cell specificity prediction (26). Given that immune\nrecognition (including TCR\u2013pMHC recognition) is generally not as accurately\nmodeled as other protein complexes by AlphaFold (27), and that others have\nnoted concerns about AlphaFold\u2019s accuracy and utility in some scenarios (28),\nwe tested the capability of AlphaFold to model TCR N17.1.2 in complex with its\nneoantigen targets, and also tested it for predictive modeling of complexes\nfor other TCRs known to bind NRASQ61K\u2013HLA-A*01. Interestingly, AlphaFold\ngenerated accurate models of both N17.1.2 complexes, but accuracy depended on\nAlphaFold implementation and the number of models produced, whereas it did not\ngenerate high scoring models for the other complexes modeled. These findings\nestablish the structural basis for T cell recognition of NRASQ61 neoantigens,\nand provide valuable insights into the accuracy and limitations of AlphaFold\nin a challenging predictive modeling scenario.\n\nResultsTCR N17.1.2 Discriminates between Mutant and Wild-type NRAS Peptides.\n\nTCR N17.1.2 was isolated by screening TILs from melanoma patients for\nreactivity towards the mutated NRASQ61K neoantigen (15).

Physical barriers like the tumor stroma additionally prevent tumor\npenetration and limit the use of CAR-T cell treatment. The extracellular\nmatrix makes up the stroma and contains heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG),\nwhich CAR-T cells must knock down in order to infiltrate the tumor.\nHeparinase, an enzyme that breaks down heparin sulfate proteoglycan, has been\nadded to CAR-T cells, increasing their anticancer activity and tumor invasion.\nSimilarly, in animal models, CAR-T cells that specifically target the\nfibroblast activation protein (FAP) exhibit improved cytotoxic efficacy by\nreducing tumor fibroblasts. However, more research is needed to develop new\ndelivery techniques to extend therapeutic efficacy to complicated solid tumors\n[162].\n\n10.4. Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5. Toxicities Associated with CAR-T Cells\n\nCAR-T cell therapy has presented promising results in some tumors, but it is\nalso associated with substantial side effects that limit its usage as a first-\nline treatment. The type of cancer, the target antigen, and the CAR design\ninfluence the risk and severity of two major toxicities: hemophagocytic\nlymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

This study showed that the side chains of T58,\nK61, and E63 form an exposed molecular surface, whereas those of I55, L56, and\nY64 are buried in the peptide-binding groove of HLA-A*01:01. However,\nunderstanding how TCRs discriminate between wild-type and mutated NRAS\nrequires knowing the structure of TCR\u2013peptide\u2013MHC (TCR\u2013pMHC) complexes (21).\nHere we report crystal structures of a TCR (N17.1.2) from a melanoma patient\nthat recognizes both NRASQ61K and NRASQ61R neoepitopes (15) in complex with\nNRASQ61K\u2013HLA-A*01 and NRASQ61R\u2013HLA-A*01, as well as the structure of the\nunbound TCR.\n\nThe deep learning method AlphaFold (22) has shown impressive performance in\npredictive modeling (23) and has been adapted and tested for modeling TCR\u2013pMHC\ncomplex structures (24, 25), which as noted recently can potentially be\nutilized for large-scale T cell specificity prediction (26). Given that immune\nrecognition (including TCR\u2013pMHC recognition) is generally not as accurately\nmodeled as other protein complexes by AlphaFold (27), and that others have\nnoted concerns about AlphaFold\u2019s accuracy and utility in some scenarios (28),\nwe tested the capability of AlphaFold to model TCR N17.1.2 in complex with its\nneoantigen targets, and also tested it for predictive modeling of complexes\nfor other TCRs known to bind NRASQ61K\u2013HLA-A*01.

{"question_new": "What are the specific antitumor mechanisms of CAR-macrophage therapy that distinguish it from CAR-T therapy, and in what clinical scenarios do these differences offer therapeutic advantages?", "answer_new": "CAR-macrophage therapy exhibits a diverse array of antitumor mechanisms, including enhanced interactions with other immune cells, potent reactivation of the tumor microenvironment, promotion of T cell infiltration persistence, and the novel ability to target the tumor extracellular matrix. These mechanisms confer advantages over CAR-T therapy, particularly in the treatment of cold tumors like breast cancer, where CAR-macrophages have shown efficacy in preclinical studies.", "id": "PMC11172642-35", "context": "activity. Physical barriers like the tumor stroma additionally prevent tumor\npenetration and limit the use of CAR-T cell treatment. The extracellular\nmatrix makes up the stroma and contains heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG),\nwhich CAR-T cells must knock down in order to infiltrate the tumor.\nHeparinase, an enzyme that breaks down heparin sulfate proteoglycan, has been\nadded to CAR-T cells, increasing their anticancer activity and tumor invasion.\nSimilarly, in animal models, CAR-T cells that specifically target the\nfibroblast activation protein (FAP) exhibit improved cytotoxic efficacy by\nreducing tumor fibroblasts. However, more research is needed to develop new\ndelivery techniques to extend therapeutic efficacy to complicated solid tumors\n[162].\n\n10.4. Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nImmunosuppressive cells are present in the tumor microenvironment and can\nsuppress the immune system. These cells include myeloid-derived suppressor\ncells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages\n(TAMs). Solid tumors are infiltrated by many types of cells that suppress the\nimmune system. These cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines\nthat facilitate tumor growth [163]. Moreover, immune checkpoint mechanisms\nsuch as CTLA-4 and PD-1 can suppress antitumor immunity. Short-term\npersistence can result in a poor expansion of T cells and poor or no response\nto CAR-T cell treatment. Co-inhibitory pathways can induce T cell exhaustion.\nTherefore, combining immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cells is\nsuggested to be a promising immunotherapy strategy because it provides the two\ncomponents necessary to boost the immune response: (i) PD-L1/PD-1 blockade,\nwhich can maintain function, and (ii) the persistence and infiltration of T\ncells and CAR-T cells. In children with pre-treatment B-ALL, CD19 and PD-1\nCAR-T cell therapy blocking increased CAR-T cell survival. One interesting\nstudy found that pre-treating 11 mesothelioma patients with cyclophosphamide\nfollowed by a single dosage of mesothelin and three doses of CAR-T cells\ntargeted against the PD-1 receptor showed a 72% response rate. However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5. Toxicities Associated with CAR-T Cells\n\nCAR-T cell therapy has presented promising results in some tumors, but it is\nalso associated with substantial side effects that limit its usage as a first-\nline treatment. The type of cancer, the target antigen, and the CAR design\ninfluence the risk and severity of two major toxicities: hemophagocytic\nlymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells.

Materials and Methods2.1. Dataset and Implementation Details\n\nThe BACH dataset utilized in this study comprises hematoxylin and eosin\n(H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images and whole-slide images.\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images were\nvaluable in this study because they provided detailed visual information\nregarding the cellular structure, morphology, and spatial distribution of\ntissues within the breast, aiding in the interpretation of pathological\nfeatures relevant to breast cancer research.\n\nIn the BACH dataset, we focused on the microscopy images, which are\nmeticulously labeled by medical experts based on the predominant cancer type\npresent in each image. Specifically, images are categorized into four classes:\nNormal, Benign, In Situ Carcinoma, and Invasive Carcinoma (see Figure 1). The\nannotation process involved the assessment of each image by two medical\nexperts, with any disagreements resulting in the exclusion of the respective\nimage from the dataset. In total, the microscopy image dataset consisted of\n400 images, evenly distributed across the four classes, with each class\ncontaining 100 images. These images were stored in .tiff format and possessed\nspecific characteristics: a color model of red\u2013green\u2013blue (RGB), dimensions of\n2048 \u00d7 1536 pixels, and a pixel scale of 0.42 \u00b5m \u00d7 0.42 \u00b5m. Additionally, the\nmemory space required for each image ranged from 10 to 20 MB, approximately.\nNotably, the labeling of the dataset was image-wise, providing comprehensive\ninformation about the cancer type represented in each image. This meticulously\ncurated dataset served as a valuable resource for training and evaluating\nmachine learning models for breast cancer histopathology image analysis.\n\nThe BreakHis dataset consists of 9109 microscopic images of breast tumor\ntissue. These images were collected from 82 patients and captured at various\nmagnification factors (40\u00d7, 100\u00d7, 200\u00d7, and 400\u00d7).

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al.

However, other\nimmunotherapies may still be needed to counteract the inhibitory signals\n[164].\n\nAdditionally, scientists are aiming to create CARs that can withstand\nimmunosuppressive elements, including TGF-mediated inhibitory signals in the\ntumor microenvironment. A different cutting-edge approach entails creating\nCAR-T cells capable of transmitting immunostimulatory signals in the form of\ncytokines, which increase proliferation, survival, and the activity of\nantitumor T cells. Studies that emphasize creating pro-inflammatory cytokines\ninstead of inhibitory signals have used IL-15 expression, IL-12 secretion, and\nrerouting the signaling of immunosuppressive cytokines (like IL-4) toward\nproinflammatory cytokines. However, the combination of CAR-T cell therapy and\ncheckpoint blockade is not enough to stimulate effector function and T cell\ninfiltration. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncombining the checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy with other\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors or complex hematological malignancies [165].\n\n10.5.

Materials and Methods2.1. Dataset and Implementation Details\n\nThe BACH dataset utilized in this study comprises hematoxylin and eosin\n(H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images and whole-slide images.\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images were\nvaluable in this study because they provided detailed visual information\nregarding the cellular structure, morphology, and spatial distribution of\ntissues within the breast, aiding in the interpretation of pathological\nfeatures relevant to breast cancer research.\n\nIn the BACH dataset, we focused on the microscopy images, which are\nmeticulously labeled by medical experts based on the predominant cancer type\npresent in each image. Specifically, images are categorized into four classes:\nNormal, Benign, In Situ Carcinoma, and Invasive Carcinoma (see Figure 1). The\nannotation process involved the assessment of each image by two medical\nexperts, with any disagreements resulting in the exclusion of the respective\nimage from the dataset. In total, the microscopy image dataset consisted of\n400 images, evenly distributed across the four classes, with each class\ncontaining 100 images. These images were stored in .tiff format and possessed\nspecific characteristics: a color model of red\u2013green\u2013blue (RGB), dimensions of\n2048 \u00d7 1536 pixels, and a pixel scale of 0.42 \u00b5m \u00d7 0.42 \u00b5m. Additionally, the\nmemory space required for each image ranged from 10 to 20 MB, approximately.\nNotably, the labeling of the dataset was image-wise, providing comprehensive\ninformation about the cancer type represented in each image. This meticulously\ncurated dataset served as a valuable resource for training and evaluating\nmachine learning models for breast cancer histopathology image analysis.\n\nThe BreakHis dataset consists of 9109 microscopic images of breast tumor\ntissue. These images were collected from 82 patients and captured at various\nmagnification factors (40\u00d7, 100\u00d7, 200\u00d7, and 400\u00d7). The dataset includes 2480\nbenign and 5429 malignant samples. Each sample is a 700 \u00d7 460 pixel, 3-channel\nRGB image with an 8-bit depth in each channel, stored in PNG format. The\ndataset categorizes tumors into benign and malignant classes, each with\nseveral subclasses. For benign tumors, these subclasses include Adenosis,\nFibroadenoma, Tubular adenoma, and Phyllodes adenoma.

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al.

Materials and Methods2.1. Dataset and Implementation Details\n\nThe BACH dataset utilized in this study comprises hematoxylin and eosin\n(H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images and whole-slide images.\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained breast histology microscopy images were\nvaluable in this study because they provided detailed visual information\nregarding the cellular structure, morphology, and spatial distribution of\ntissues within the breast, aiding in the interpretation of pathological\nfeatures relevant to breast cancer research.\n\nIn the BACH dataset, we focused on the microscopy images, which are\nmeticulously labeled by medical experts based on the predominant cancer type\npresent in each image. Specifically, images are categorized into four classes:\nNormal, Benign, In Situ Carcinoma, and Invasive Carcinoma (see Figure 1). The\nannotation process involved the assessment of each image by two medical\nexperts, with any disagreements resulting in the exclusion of the respective\nimage from the dataset. In total, the microscopy image dataset consisted of\n400 images, evenly distributed across the four classes, with each class\ncontaining 100 images. These images were stored in .tiff format and possessed\nspecific characteristics: a color model of red\u2013green\u2013blue (RGB), dimensions of\n2048 \u00d7 1536 pixels, and a pixel scale of 0.42 \u00b5m \u00d7 0.42 \u00b5m. Additionally, the\nmemory space required for each image ranged from 10 to 20 MB, approximately.\nNotably, the labeling of the dataset was image-wise, providing comprehensive\ninformation about the cancer type represented in each image. This meticulously\ncurated dataset served as a valuable resource for training and evaluating\nmachine learning models for breast cancer histopathology image analysis.\n\nThe BreakHis dataset consists of 9109 microscopic images of breast tumor\ntissue. These images were collected from 82 patients and captured at various\nmagnification factors (40\u00d7, 100\u00d7, 200\u00d7, and 400\u00d7).

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al. [140] looked at the co-\neffects of sulforaphane and metformin on MCF-10A, MCF-7, and BT-474 cells.\nAlthough each compound has its own impact on cell\n\n", "question": "What is the major target of sulforaphane?", "answer": "Nrf2, a transcription factor that regulates antioxidant and cytoprotective enzymes.", "prompt": "Re-write the question such that its answer is not general and appropriately states exceptions and conditions to demonstrate a deep and nuanced understanding of the question."}

Other recent work has identified a TCR mimic\nantibody that targets NRASQ61R and HLA-A*01:01, underscoring the interest in\nthat neoantigen as an immunotherapeutic target (19).\n\nMcShan et al. (20) recently determined the solution structure of the\nNRASQ61K\u2013HLA-A*01:01 complex by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and used\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations to probe the conformational dynamics of\nthe MHC-bound NRASQ61K peptide. This study showed that the side chains of T58,\nK61, and E63 form an exposed molecular surface, whereas those of I55, L56, and\nY64 are buried in the peptide-binding groove of HLA-A*01:01. However,\nunderstanding how TCRs discriminate between wild-type and mutated NRAS\nrequires knowing the structure of TCR\u2013peptide\u2013MHC (TCR\u2013pMHC) complexes (21).\nHere we report crystal structures of a TCR (N17.1.2) from a melanoma patient\nthat recognizes both NRASQ61K and NRASQ61R neoepitopes (15) in complex with\nNRASQ61K\u2013HLA-A*01 and NRASQ61R\u2013HLA-A*01, as well as the structure of the\nunbound TCR.\n\nThe deep learning method AlphaFold (22) has shown impressive performance in\npredictive modeling (23) and has been adapted and tested for modeling TCR\u2013pMHC\ncomplex structures (24, 25), which as noted recently can potentially be\nutilized for large-scale T cell specificity prediction (26). Given that immune\nrecognition (including TCR\u2013pMHC recognition) is generally not as accurately\nmodeled as other protein complexes by AlphaFold (27), and that others have\nnoted concerns about AlphaFold\u2019s accuracy and utility in some scenarios (28),\nwe tested the capability of AlphaFold to model TCR N17.1.2 in complex with its\nneoantigen targets, and also tested it for predictive modeling of complexes\nfor other TCRs known to bind NRASQ61K\u2013HLA-A*01. Interestingly, AlphaFold\ngenerated accurate models of both N17.1.2 complexes, but accuracy depended on\nAlphaFold implementation and the number of models produced, whereas it did not\ngenerate high scoring models for the other complexes modeled. These findings\nestablish the structural basis for T cell recognition of NRASQ61 neoantigens,\nand provide valuable insights into the accuracy and limitations of AlphaFold\nin a challenging predictive modeling scenario.\n\nResultsTCR N17.1.2 Discriminates between Mutant and Wild-type NRAS Peptides.\n\nTCR N17.1.2 was isolated by screening TILs from melanoma patients for\nreactivity towards the mutated NRASQ61K neoantigen (15).

We used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to measure the\naffinity of TCR N17.1.2 for HLA-A1 loaded with wild-type or mutant NRAS\npeptides (Fig. 1).

Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane is characterized by an electrophilic central carbon, which is\npart of the isothiocyanate group and can react with cysteine residues from\nother molecules and facilitate interactions with important signaling mediators\n[133] such as Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and inflammasome complexes.\n\nSulforaphane\u2019s major target is Nrf2, a transcription factor that, after being\nactivated, migrates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response\nelements (AREs), resulting in the enhanced expression of antioxidant and\ncytoprotective enzymes (e.g., NQO1, HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic\nsubunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD) (Figure 3). Licznerska et al. [134] found that\nNrf2 expression increased after sulforaphane treatment, showing the highest\nincrease in MCF-7 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 and MCF10-A control cells. Nrf2\nantioxidant signaling, induced by sulforaphane, reportedly disrupts the NF-\u03baB\npathway [135]. Kim et al. [136] evaluated the synergistic effect of paclitaxel\nand sulforaphane treatment on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Sulforaphane\u2019s\npresence in MDA-MB-231 cells prevented paclitaxel from activating NF-\u03baB,\nexpressing Bcl-2, and phosphorylating AKT. According to the authors,\npaclitaxel activates NF-\u03baB through the classic signaling pathway, which\ninvolves IKK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. The activation of IKK caused by\npaclitaxel was suppressed by sulforaphane treatment, which in turn suppressed\nthe activation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, sulforaphane and paclitaxel co-\nadministration resulted in an improvement in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis\nthrough caspase-3, -8, and -9 while reducing Bcl-2 expression [136] (Figure\n3). The regulation of inflammatory mediators, which are crucial for BC growth\nand progression, is a widely recognized function of NF-\u03baB. Hunakova et al.\n[137] showed that sulforaphane inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g.,\nIL-4), and growth factors involved in angiogenesis (PDGF and VEGF) in a manner\ndependent on dosage.\n\nTo date, it has demonstrated that sulforaphanes in combination with classic\nchemotherapy drugs increase their effectiveness and safety. Xu et al. [138]\nshowed that nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of cisplatin and sulforaphane\ndecrease intracellular levels of glutathione via indirect sulforaphane\nNrf2-activation. The significant reduction in glutathione was accompanied by a\nlarge rise in DNA-bound cisplatin and in death brought on by damage to DNA,\nrestoring cisplatin chemosensitivity [138]. The effects of doxorubicin and\nsulforaphane were investigated by Rong et al. [139] using in vitro and in vivo\nstudies. Usually, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by high levels\nof PGE2 (Figure 3). BC cells that are resistant to doxorubicin produce PGE2,\nwhich creates an immunosuppressive environment. Sulforaphane treatment can\nenhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs by blocking NF-\u03baB and\ninhibiting the COX-2 level. Keshandehghan et al.

Uveresky [27] has appropriately\nused the term \u201cp53 firework\u201d (rather than network) to illustrate the mind-\nnumbing complexity of p53 proteoforms.\n\nThe firework extends to p53 downstream events, given its well-known function\nas a transcription regulator. A meta-analysis reported in 2017 identified over\n3500 genes that are directly upregulated by p53 [31]. In addition, p53\ninteracts with a large number of proteins [32] and contributes to the\nstability of the epigenetic state [33,34].\n\nAn illustration of p53-interacting proteins is available online (cited in\n[32]).

Compound 4, known as intervenolin (Figure 1), demonstrates\nactivity against human gastric cancer cells (MKN-74) with an IC50 value of 7.0\n\u00b5M and against colorectal cancer cells (HCT-15) with an IC50 value of 3.7 \u00b5M\n[9,10]. The in vitro anticancer efficacy of intervenolin (4) was even higher\nwhen tested in these cancer cell lines cocultured with the corresponding\nstromal cells Hs738 (IC50 = 0.4 \u00b5M) and CCd-18Co (IC50 = 0.5 \u00b5M), suggesting\nenhanced effectiveness due to intercellular interactions resembling\nphysiological conditions [11].\n\nAnother important class of compounds recognized for their anticancer\nproperties is 1,4-quinones [12,13,14]. Doxorubicin (5) (Figure 2), for\ninstance, is an anthracycline 1,4-quinone derivative that has been used\nclinically since the 1960s in chemotherapy for various cancer types [15,16].\nLapachol (6) is a cytotoxic 1,4-naphthoquinone considered a potential\nanticancer drug that has reached clinical phase studies. However, these\nstudies were discontinued due to an association with severe anemia, blood\ncoagulation disorders, and gastrointestinal and renal toxicity [13,17].\nConsequently, research into the preparation of new, more effective and\nselective antitumor compounds within this class has continued over the years.\nA recent example is compound 7, which exhibits high cytotoxicity against MCF-7\nhuman breast cancer cells [18].\n\nEven structurally simple 1,4-quinone derivatives have significant cytotoxic\npotential in this context. 1,4-naphthoquinone itself (8) has a broad spectrum\nof antitumor activity, being able to potently inhibit angiogenesis and the\ngrowth of colon cancer cells (HCT116), for example, although in a non-\nselective way [19]. Another example is plumbagin (9), a natural compound\nisolated from Plumbago zeylanica L. that selectively induces apoptosis in\nrefractory invasive prostate cancer cells (DU145) without affecting non-\ntumorigenic prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1). Plumbagin also promoted tumor\nreduction by 90% in an in vivo screening after administration of 2 mg/kg (body\nweight) after three weeks of treatment [20].\n\nThe conjugation of two or more bioactive fragments within the same structure\nis a strategy used in medicinal chemistry for the rational design of new drug\ncandidates. This approach aims to create compounds with a bioactive profile\nsuperior to that of the isolated original prototypes. This strategy can be\nparticularly valuable for developing compounds with multitarget action that\nare capable of interacting with different receptors or through different\nmechanisms [21,22].\n\nRecently, we synthesized a series of lapachol/1,2,3-triazol/4-quinolone\nhybrids based on this strategy.

HE staining (Figure 6a) and Safranin O\nstaining (Figure 6b) showed no tissue damage and no difference in staining in\neither group.

Discussion\n\nWe evaluated the effects of a thermal stimulation technique using\nphotosensitizers and NIR irradiation on chondrocytes and articular cartilage.\nIn vitro, this method can apply moderate thermal stimulation, at about 40 \u00b0C,\nto the culture medium of chondrocytes, and it was found that the enhancement\nof HSP70 expression heightened the cartilage metabolic activity. In vivo, a\nmoderate temperature increase in the knee joints of rats was found to increase\nHSP70 expression and cartilage metabolic activity.\n\nThermotherapy is widely used in clinical practice as a physical therapy for OA\nand has been shown to reduce pain by increasing the pain threshold of soft\ntissues, increase the elasticity of collagen fibers, relax muscles due to\ndecreased sensitivity to muscle spindle stretch, and increase local blood flow\n[13,14,15]. In vitro, heat stimulation of chondrocytes at an appropriate level\n(39\u201341.8 \u00b0C for 15\u201330 min) positively affected cell viability and aggrecan\nmetabolism in chondrocytes [6], and in vivo, increasing the intra-articular\ntemperature to approximately 40 \u00b0C suppressed OA [7]. It has been reported\nthat heating the articular cartilage inhibits cartilage degeneration.\nConventional thermal stimulation techniques such as bathing, hot packs, and MW\ncan easily heat the entire joints of small-to-medium-sized animals such as\nrabbits, but it is difficult for thermal energy to reach the cartilage located\ndeep in human-sized joints [8,16,17]. In order to maximize the cartilage-\nprotective effect of hyperthermia in clinical practice, it is essential to\ndevelop new thermal stimulation techniques that can efficiently heat deep\njoints.

HE staining (Figure 6a) and Safranin O\nstaining (Figure 6b) showed no tissue damage and no difference in staining in\neither group.

In vivo, a\nmoderate temperature increase in the knee joints of rats was found to increase\nHSP70 expression and cartilage metabolic activity.\n\nThermotherapy is widely used in clinical practice as a physical therapy for OA\nand has been shown to reduce pain by increasing the pain threshold of soft\ntissues, increase the elasticity of collagen fibers, relax muscles due to\ndecreased sensitivity to muscle spindle stretch, and increase local blood flow\n[13,14,15]. In vitro, heat stimulation of chondrocytes at an appropriate level\n(39\u201341.8 \u00b0C for 15\u201330 min) positively affected cell viability and aggrecan\nmetabolism in chondrocytes [6], and in vivo, increasing the intra-articular\ntemperature to approximately 40 \u00b0C suppressed OA [7]. It has been reported\nthat heating the articular cartilage inhibits cartilage degeneration.\nConventional thermal stimulation techniques such as bathing, hot packs, and MW\ncan easily heat the entire joints of small-to-medium-sized animals such as\nrabbits, but it is difficult for thermal energy to reach the cartilage located\ndeep in human-sized joints [8,16,17].

In vitro, heat stimulation of chondrocytes at an appropriate level\n(39\u201341.8 \u00b0C for 15\u201330 min) positively affected cell viability and aggrecan\nmetabolism in chondrocytes [6], and in vivo, increasing the intra-articular\ntemperature to approximately 40 \u00b0C suppressed OA [7]. It has been reported\nthat heating the articular cartilage inhibits cartilage degeneration.\nConventional thermal stimulation techniques such as bathing, hot packs, and MW\ncan easily heat the entire joints of small-to-medium-sized animals such as\nrabbits, but it is difficult for thermal energy to reach the cartilage located\ndeep in human-sized joints [8,16,17].

The ACAN gene expression levels in the ICG+NIR group\nwere also significantly elevated\u20142.0-fold, on average\u2014compared to the control\ngroup (p < 0.05), while other gene expression levels were not significantly\ndifferent.\n\n3\\.

In vivo, a\nmoderate temperature increase in the knee joints of rats was found to increase\nHSP70 expression and cartilage metabolic activity.\n\nThermotherapy is widely used in clinical practice as a physical therapy for OA\nand has been shown to reduce pain by increasing the pain threshold of soft\ntissues, increase the elasticity of collagen fibers, relax muscles due to\ndecreased sensitivity to muscle spindle stretch, and increase local blood flow\n[13,14,15]. In vitro, heat stimulation of chondrocytes at an appropriate level\n(39\u201341.8 \u00b0C for 15\u201330 min) positively affected cell viability and aggrecan\nmetabolism in chondrocytes [6], and in vivo, increasing the intra-articular\ntemperature to approximately 40 \u00b0C suppressed OA [7]. It has been reported\nthat heating the articular cartilage inhibits cartilage degeneration.\nConventional thermal stimulation techniques such as bathing, hot packs, and MW\ncan easily heat the entire joints of small-to-medium-sized animals such as\nrabbits, but it is difficult for thermal energy to reach the cartilage located\ndeep in human-sized joints [8,16,17].

The ACAN gene expression levels in the ICG+NIR group\nwere also significantly elevated\u20142.0-fold, on average\u2014compared to the control\ngroup (p < 0.05), while other gene expression levels were not significantly\ndifferent.\n\n3\\. Discussion\n\nWe evaluated the effects of a thermal stimulation technique using\nphotosensitizers and NIR irradiation on chondrocytes and articular cartilage.\nIn vitro, this method can apply moderate thermal stimulation, at about 40 \u00b0C,\nto the culture medium of chondrocytes, and it was found that the enhancement\nof HSP70 expression heightened the cartilage metabolic activity. In vivo, a\nmoderate temperature increase in the knee joints of rats was found to increase\nHSP70 expression and cartilage metabolic activity.\n\nThermotherapy is widely used in clinical practice as a physical therapy for OA\nand has been shown to reduce pain by increasing the pain threshold of soft\ntissues, increase the elasticity of collagen fibers, relax muscles due to\ndecreased sensitivity to muscle spindle stretch, and increase local blood flow\n[13,14,15]. In vitro, heat stimulation of chondrocytes at an appropriate level\n(39\u201341.8 \u00b0C for 15\u201330 min) positively affected cell viability and aggrecan\nmetabolism in chondrocytes [6], and in vivo, increasing the intra-articular\ntemperature to approximately 40 \u00b0C suppressed OA [7]. It has been reported\nthat heating the articular cartilage inhibits cartilage degeneration.\nConventional thermal stimulation techniques such as bathing, hot packs, and MW\ncan easily heat the entire joints of small-to-medium-sized animals such as\nrabbits, but it is difficult for thermal energy to reach the cartilage located\ndeep in human-sized joints [8,16,17]. In order to maximize the cartilage-\nprotective effect of hyperthermia in clinical practice, it is essential to\ndevelop new thermal stimulation techniques that can efficiently heat deep\njoints.

Non-\nmeasurable peritoneal carcinomatosis (18%) and post-therapeutic changes to\ntarget lesions resulting in non-measurability (15%) were the second and third\nmost common reason, respectively. Some cancer entities presented with more\nfrequent metastatic pattern of non-measurability. This was the case for non-\nmeasurable peritoneal carcinomatosis commonly observed in cases of advanced\novarian cancer (n = 6/22, 27%). Osteoblastic metastases were also a common\nreason for NMD (14% overall) with most cases observed in patients with breast\ncancer (n = 13/55, 24%). Eight of all patients with breast cancer (15%) had\nonly osteoblastic metastases and therefore were classified as NMD.\n\nMeasurable disease non-representative of tumor burden\n\nEleven patients (6%) had MD that was not representative of the overall tumor\nburden (Fig. 2). The patients were categorized in this group in the case of\nsolitary measurable target lesions according to RECIST and simultaneous\npresence of extensive NMD such as extensive non-measurable peritoneal\ncarcinomatosis or disseminated small metastases (pulmonary or hepatic). The\nmajority of these patients presented either with prostate or breast cancer\nwith solitary measurable target lesions and extensive non-measurable\nosteoblastic metastases (n = 8). Two patients had progressive ovarian cancer\nwith solitary liver metastases as MD and extensive peritoneal carcinomatosis\nas NMD.
