This results in the up-regulation of a large number of genes involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), which aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

By identifying this syndrome, healthcare providers can refine treatment strategies, potentially reducing the need for QoL-reducing factors like mastectomy, and improve patient care through targeted interventions.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors.

Their ability to target specific cancer cells, such as those with overexpressed nucleolin receptors, can further improve treatment outcomes. Moreover, nanoparticles like cerium oxide can accumulate in tumor cells, leading to the conversion of unstable superoxides into hydrogen peroxide, which sensitizes the cell to ionizing radiation.", "context": "CAFs are induced by cancer cells through TGF-\u03b2, and they create a mechanical\nbarrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth. Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions.

PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024).

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024).

These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions.

These concerns must be carefully weighed against the potential benefits of using epigenetic age estimators to promote healthier and longer lives.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021).

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023).

The ADC undergoes proteolytic cleavage, followed by the breakdown of the disulfide bond due to the elevated intracellular glutathione levels in cancer cells, which releases the active drug. This release allows the active drug to diffuse into adjacent cancer cells, resulting in a bystander effect. Finally, the active drug is enzymatically metabolized by S-methyltransferase.", "context": "CAFs are induced by cancer cells through TGF-\u03b2, and they create a mechanical\nbarrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth. Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

In breast cancer, miR-122 has been found to be overexpressed in serum, suggesting its potential as an onco-microRNA. Overall, the study of miRNAs in breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis has shown promising results, highlighting their potential as minimally invasive, cost-effective diagnostic biomarkers.", "context": "CAFs are induced by cancer cells through TGF-\u03b2, and they create a mechanical\nbarrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth. Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

The mortality of BC\npatients has been significantly reduced by radical surgery, radiotherapy,\nchemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy within the past decade,\nbut many patients still experience recurrence or metastasis, eventually\nleading to death2. The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5. Mitochondria are the key organelles involved in\nmetabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, and maintaining mitochondrial\nintegrity is the absolute basis of oxidative phosphorylation6.

This, in turn, enhances the proliferation, invasion, and migration capabilities of the cells. Conversely, silencing ESM1 has the opposite effect, inhibiting EMT by upregulating E-cadherin and downregulating Vimentin and ZEB1, highlighting the significant role of ESM1 in modulating cellular processes critical to cancer progression.", "context": "CAFs are induced by cancer cells through TGF-\u03b2, and they create a mechanical\nbarrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth. Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

This, in turn, activates a broad array of genes integral to the UPR, thereby facilitating the cellular response to ER stress.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors.

Moreover, the KEYNOTE-966 clinical trial showed that adding anti-PD-1 immunotherapy pembrolizumab to gemcitabine and cisplatin also improved overall survival, although the benefit in progression-free survival was not statistically significant.", "context": "Introduction\n\nIn terms of malignancies in women, breast cancer (BC) is the most common and\none of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide1. The mortality of BC\npatients has been significantly reduced by radical surgery, radiotherapy,\nchemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy within the past decade,\nbut many patients still experience recurrence or metastasis, eventually\nleading to death2. The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5. Mitochondria are the key organelles involved in\nmetabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, and maintaining mitochondrial\nintegrity is the absolute basis of oxidative phosphorylation6. In addition,\nprevious studies have also indicated that the number, structure, and function\nof mitochondria often change in malignant tumor cells to meet the needs of\nrapid growth in acidic and anoxic environments7.\n\nAs a key regulatory subunit of mitochondrial integrity, mitochondrial inner\nmembrane protein (IMMT), also known as Mic-60 or Mitofilin8, is not only an\nimportant part of the mitochondrial contact sites and cristae organization\nsystem (MICOS) complex, but it also interacts with members of the SAM (The\nSorting and Assembly Machinery) complex to form the mitochondrial membrane\nspace bridging complex9. Recent studies have linked IMMT to the onset of\nvarious diseases, including cardiomyopathy10, degenerative encephalopathy11\nand kidney injury12. However, research on the significance of IMMT in cancers\nis rare, and the only literature proposed that IMMT expression might be\nrelated to cancer prognosis13,14. To date, few reports have been published on\nthe relationship between IMMT and the development and progression of BC, and\nthe functions of IMMT in BC remains largely undefined.\n\nThe purpose of this investigation was to delve into the potential functions\nand underlying biological processes of IMMT in the development and progression\nof BC. To achieve this objective, bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry\n(IHC) were utilized to determine the prognostic significance of IMMT and its\ncorrelation with clinicopathological parameters in BC patients.

Its deficiency leads to the release of cytochrome c but does not induce mitochondrial apoptosis, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, IMMT is involved in metabolic regulation in BC, with high expression associated with the enrichment of various metabolic pathways, including those related to amino acid, fatty acid, and nucleotide sugar metabolism.", "context": "CAFs are induced by cancer cells through TGF-\u03b2, and they create a mechanical\nbarrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth. Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239].

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

However, the causal relationship between early menarche and obesity remains uncertain, and further longitudinal studies are necessary to elucidate this relationship.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth. They are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate cytokines and chemokines, which further stimulate cancer growth.

This suggests that FXT treatment disrupts the normal autophagic flux, leading to an imbalance in the autophagic process.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

The underlying mechanisms are complex and involve metabolic alterations such as deregulation of sex hormones, overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, insulin resistance, and hyperactivation of insulin-like growth factor pathways. Biomarkers like serum sex hormone-binding globulin, IGF-1, testosterone, and C-reactive protein have been associated with both body shapes and breast cancer risk, suggesting they may mediate the relationship between body shape and breast cancer.", "context": "CAFs are induced by cancer cells through TGF-\u03b2, and they create a mechanical\nbarrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth. Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023).

In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021). Alternol was isolated from the fermentation of a mutant fungus obtained from Taxus brevifolia bark (Liu et al., 2020).

The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages.

The mutated TP53 gene leads to the loss of wild-type p53 function, which is crucial for regulating proteins involved in the DNA damage response. As a result, cancer cells with TP53 mutations exhibit reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy, including platinum-based regimens. This resistance is linked to a poorer overall survival rate in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

By adopting a proactive and informed approach, clinicians can improve outcomes for individuals with type 2 diabetes who are at risk of developing melanoma.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

They can penetrate tumors via the activated transendothelial pathway and leverage the enhanced permeability and retention effect to efficiently accumulate in tumor tissues, ultimately capitalizing on their distinctive attributes to enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatment.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021). Alternol was isolated from the fermentation of a mutant fungus obtained from Taxus brevifolia bark (Liu et al., 2020).

The mortality of BC\npatients has been significantly reduced by radical surgery, radiotherapy,\nchemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy within the past decade,\nbut many patients still experience recurrence or metastasis, eventually\nleading to death2. The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5. Mitochondria are the key organelles involved in\nmetabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, and maintaining mitochondrial\nintegrity is the absolute basis of oxidative phosphorylation6. In addition,\nprevious studies have also indicated that the number, structure, and function\nof mitochondria often change in malignant tumor cells to meet the needs of\nrapid growth in acidic and anoxic environments7.\n\nAs a key regulatory subunit of mitochondrial integrity, mitochondrial inner\nmembrane protein (IMMT), also known as Mic-60 or Mitofilin8, is not only an\nimportant part of the mitochondrial contact sites and cristae organization\nsystem (MICOS) complex, but it also interacts with members of the SAM (The\nSorting and Assembly Machinery) complex to form the mitochondrial membrane\nspace bridging complex9. Recent studies have linked IMMT to the onset of\nvarious diseases, including cardiomyopathy10, degenerative encephalopathy11\nand kidney injury12. However, research on the significance of IMMT in cancers\nis rare, and the only literature proposed that IMMT expression might be\nrelated to cancer prognosis13,14.

Their dysregulation can serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, guiding treatment strategies and indicating disease progression. For instance, miR-122 has been shown to target oncogenes in hepatocellular carcinoma and is overexpressed in breast cancer, while miR-574-5p overexpression inhibits tumorigenesis and lung metastasis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of miRNAs can provide insights into their utility as therapeutic targets and biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis.", "context": "CAFs are induced by cancer cells through TGF-\u03b2, and they create a mechanical\nbarrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth. Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

Understanding the interactions between these chemicals and genetic markers can provide insights into the underlying mechanisms driving breast cancer development and progression, ultimately informing the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.", "context": "Introduction\n\nIn terms of malignancies in women, breast cancer (BC) is the most common and\none of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide1. The mortality of BC\npatients has been significantly reduced by radical surgery, radiotherapy,\nchemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy within the past decade,\nbut many patients still experience recurrence or metastasis, eventually\nleading to death2. The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5.

These locations exhibit the induction of estrogen response genes, underscoring the pivotal role of ER\u03b1 in mediating estrogenic effects within these tissues.", "context": "CAFs are induced by cancer cells through TGF-\u03b2, and they create a mechanical\nbarrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth. Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239].

Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239].

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

However, this effect can be minimized in accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) where treatment volumes are small, resulting in less skin involvement.

In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239].

However, challenges arise due to the scarcity of data, similar manifestations with adverse reactions of intensive antineoplastic therapies, and the lack of proven efficient treatments or interventions in preventing or controlling the inadequate response of the body in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors.

However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5. Mitochondria are the key organelles involved in\nmetabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, and maintaining mitochondrial\nintegrity is the absolute basis of oxidative phosphorylation6. In addition,\nprevious studies have also indicated that the number, structure, and function\nof mitochondria often change in malignant tumor cells to meet the needs of\nrapid growth in acidic and anoxic environments7.\n\nAs a key regulatory subunit of mitochondrial integrity, mitochondrial inner\nmembrane protein (IMMT), also known as Mic-60 or Mitofilin8, is not only an\nimportant part of the mitochondrial contact sites and cristae organization\nsystem (MICOS) complex, but it also interacts with members of the SAM (The\nSorting and Assembly Machinery) complex to form the mitochondrial membrane\nspace bridging complex9. Recent studies have linked IMMT to the onset of\nvarious diseases, including cardiomyopathy10, degenerative encephalopathy11\nand kidney injury12. However, research on the significance of IMMT in cancers\nis rare, and the only literature proposed that IMMT expression might be\nrelated to cancer prognosis13,14. To date, few reports have been published on\nthe relationship between IMMT and the development and progression of BC, and\nthe functions of IMMT in BC remains largely undefined.\n\nThe purpose of this investigation was to delve into the potential functions\nand underlying biological processes of IMMT in the development and progression\nof BC. To achieve this objective, bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry\n(IHC) were utilized to determine the prognostic significance of IMMT and its\ncorrelation with clinicopathological parameters in BC patients.

However, its prevalence can vary depending on factors such as geographic location, lifestyle, and genetic predisposition.", "context": "CAFs are induced by cancer cells through TGF-\u03b2, and they create a mechanical\nbarrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth. Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions.

However, individual factors, such as the timing of HRT initiation, duration of use, and individual health status, can affect this relationship. Additionally, the use of certain bioidentical progestogen products, such as micronized progesterone, may also impact breast cancer risk. It is essential to consider these factors when evaluating the effect of hormone replacement therapy on breast cancer risk.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238].

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

CAC can be distinguished from breast cancer through histological examination, revealing characteristic features such as the presence of ductal and glandular structures with eosinophilic secretions in the glandular lumens, and the absence of precursor lesions or ectopic mammary tissue.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023).

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions.

The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239].

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021).

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022).

These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

In the case of SARS-CoV-2, apoptosis is induced in respiratory epithelial cells, which can lead to lung injury, multi-organ failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 triggers apoptosis in immune cells, such as B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and monocytes, contributing to impaired immune responses and severe clinical symptoms. MERS-CoV also activates both endogenous and exogenous apoptotic pathways, resulting in extensive apoptosis of various cell types, including bronchial epithelial cells, renal cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, leading to high morbidity and mortality.

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

Additionally, the regulatory relationship between ETS1 and SOAT1 may be disrupted in certain cellular contexts, such as in the presence of specific small molecules or under conditions of cellular stress.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages.

Together, these stress sensors help maintain ER homeostasis by regulating various cellular processes, including protein translation and the unfolded protein response.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023).

The mortality of BC\npatients has been significantly reduced by radical surgery, radiotherapy,\nchemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy within the past decade,\nbut many patients still experience recurrence or metastasis, eventually\nleading to death2. The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5. Mitochondria are the key organelles involved in\nmetabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, and maintaining mitochondrial\nintegrity is the absolute basis of oxidative phosphorylation6. In addition,\nprevious studies have also indicated that the number, structure, and function\nof mitochondria often change in malignant tumor cells to meet the needs of\nrapid growth in acidic and anoxic environments7.\n\nAs a key regulatory subunit of mitochondrial integrity, mitochondrial inner\nmembrane protein (IMMT), also known as Mic-60 or Mitofilin8, is not only an\nimportant part of the mitochondrial contact sites and cristae organization\nsystem (MICOS) complex, but it also interacts with members of the SAM (The\nSorting and Assembly Machinery) complex to form the mitochondrial membrane\nspace bridging complex9.

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239].

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

The mortality of BC\npatients has been significantly reduced by radical surgery, radiotherapy,\nchemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy within the past decade,\nbut many patients still experience recurrence or metastasis, eventually\nleading to death2. The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5. Mitochondria are the key organelles involved in\nmetabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, and maintaining mitochondrial\nintegrity is the absolute basis of oxidative phosphorylation6.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

The mortality of BC\npatients has been significantly reduced by radical surgery, radiotherapy,\nchemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy within the past decade,\nbut many patients still experience recurrence or metastasis, eventually\nleading to death2. The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5. Mitochondria are the key organelles involved in\nmetabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, and maintaining mitochondrial\nintegrity is the absolute basis of oxidative phosphorylation6. In addition,\nprevious studies have also indicated that the number, structure, and function\nof mitochondria often change in malignant tumor cells to meet the needs of\nrapid growth in acidic and anoxic environments7.\n\nAs a key regulatory subunit of mitochondrial integrity, mitochondrial inner\nmembrane protein (IMMT), also known as Mic-60 or Mitofilin8, is not only an\nimportant part of the mitochondrial contact sites and cristae organization\nsystem (MICOS) complex, but it also interacts with members of the SAM (The\nSorting and Assembly Machinery) complex to form the mitochondrial membrane\nspace bridging complex9. Recent studies have linked IMMT to the onset of\nvarious diseases, including cardiomyopathy10, degenerative encephalopathy11\nand kidney injury12. However, research on the significance of IMMT in cancers\nis rare, and the only literature proposed that IMMT expression might be\nrelated to cancer prognosis13,14. To date, few reports have been published on\nthe relationship between IMMT and the development and progression of BC, and\nthe functions of IMMT in BC remains largely undefined.\n\nThe purpose of this investigation was to delve into the potential functions\nand underlying biological processes of IMMT in the development and progression\nof BC.

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression.

In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239].

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021). Alternol was isolated from the fermentation of a mutant fungus obtained from Taxus brevifolia bark (Liu et al., 2020).

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

The mortality of BC\npatients has been significantly reduced by radical surgery, radiotherapy,\nchemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy within the past decade,\nbut many patients still experience recurrence or metastasis, eventually\nleading to death2. The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5. Mitochondria are the key organelles involved in\nmetabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, and maintaining mitochondrial\nintegrity is the absolute basis of oxidative phosphorylation6. In addition,\nprevious studies have also indicated that the number, structure, and function\nof mitochondria often change in malignant tumor cells to meet the needs of\nrapid growth in acidic and anoxic environments7.\n\nAs a key regulatory subunit of mitochondrial integrity, mitochondrial inner\nmembrane protein (IMMT), also known as Mic-60 or Mitofilin8, is not only an\nimportant part of the mitochondrial contact sites and cristae organization\nsystem (MICOS) complex, but it also interacts with members of the SAM (The\nSorting and Assembly Machinery) complex to form the mitochondrial membrane\nspace bridging complex9.

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

Additionally, an increase of 5 kg/m2 in BMI is associated with menarche occurring 7.9 months earlier.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

The mortality of BC\npatients has been significantly reduced by radical surgery, radiotherapy,\nchemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy within the past decade,\nbut many patients still experience recurrence or metastasis, eventually\nleading to death2. The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5. Mitochondria are the key organelles involved in\nmetabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, and maintaining mitochondrial\nintegrity is the absolute basis of oxidative phosphorylation6. In addition,\nprevious studies have also indicated that the number, structure, and function\nof mitochondria often change in malignant tumor cells to meet the needs of\nrapid growth in acidic and anoxic environments7.\n\nAs a key regulatory subunit of mitochondrial integrity, mitochondrial inner\nmembrane protein (IMMT), also known as Mic-60 or Mitofilin8, is not only an\nimportant part of the mitochondrial contact sites and cristae organization\nsystem (MICOS) complex, but it also interacts with members of the SAM (The\nSorting and Assembly Machinery) complex to form the mitochondrial membrane\nspace bridging complex9.

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021). Alternol was isolated from the fermentation of a mutant fungus obtained from Taxus brevifolia bark (Liu et al., 2020).

Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237].

Additionally, PSMA expression is correlated with immunohistochemical factors, including Ki67 levels, further supporting its role as a biomarker.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions.

Additionally, there is a need for population-based studies with large populations to support the findings of increased melanoma stages at the time of diagnosis among individuals with T2D.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021). Alternol was isolated from the fermentation of a mutant fungus obtained from Taxus brevifolia bark (Liu et al., 2020).

This process leads to the release of the cytotoxic agent, which can then diffuse into adjacent cancer cells, inducing the bystander effect.", "context": "CAFs are induced by cancer cells through TGF-\u03b2, and they create a mechanical\nbarrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth. Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239].

Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4.

The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5.

Dexrazoxane, in particular, has been shown to be effective in preventing cardiac injury by inhibiting topoisomerase II \u03b2 and chelating free iron.", "context": "CAFs are induced by cancer cells through TGF-\u03b2, and they create a mechanical\nbarrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth. Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239].

Additionally, they offer improved electron transfer kinetics, strong adsorption capacity, high sensitivity, and excellent light absorption capabilities, making them ideal for biomedical applications such as photodynamic and photothermal therapies.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

This approach has the potential to improve diagnosis accuracy, reduce the need for invasive procedures, and enhance patient outcomes.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

The mortality of BC\npatients has been significantly reduced by radical surgery, radiotherapy,\nchemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy within the past decade,\nbut many patients still experience recurrence or metastasis, eventually\nleading to death2. The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5.

{"question_new": "What is the function of cancer-associated fibroblasts in the pancreatic environment?", "answer_new": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts play a dual role in the pancreatic environment, as they can both promote and inhibit tumor growth. They are reprogrammed by IL-1 to produce cytokines and chemokines that stimulate cancer growth. Additionally, they contribute to an immune-suppressive environment by releasing substances such as prostaglandin E2, IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8.", "context": "CAFs are induced by cancer cells through TGF-\u03b2, and they create a mechanical\nbarrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth. Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions.

Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237].

It allows for a comprehensive examination before clinical manifestations occur, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes, prolonged survival, and enhanced quality of life.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239].

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

{"question_new": "What genes are linked to an increased risk of breast cancer?", "answer_new": "The risk genes associated with breast cancer are PALB2, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, and CHEK2.", "context": "Introduction\n\nIn terms of malignancies in women, breast cancer (BC) is the most common and\none of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide1. The mortality of BC\npatients has been significantly reduced by radical surgery, radiotherapy,\nchemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy within the past decade,\nbut many patients still experience recurrence or metastasis, eventually\nleading to death2. The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5. Mitochondria are the key organelles involved in\nmetabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, and maintaining mitochondrial\nintegrity is the absolute basis of oxidative phosphorylation6. In addition,\nprevious studies have also indicated that the number, structure, and function\nof mitochondria often change in malignant tumor cells to meet the needs of\nrapid growth in acidic and anoxic environments7.\n\nAs a key regulatory subunit of mitochondrial integrity, mitochondrial inner\nmembrane protein (IMMT), also known as Mic-60 or Mitofilin8, is not only an\nimportant part of the mitochondrial contact sites and cristae organization\nsystem (MICOS) complex, but it also interacts with members of the SAM (The\nSorting and Assembly Machinery) complex to form the mitochondrial membrane\nspace bridging complex9. Recent studies have linked IMMT to the onset of\nvarious diseases, including cardiomyopathy10, degenerative encephalopathy11\nand kidney injury12. However, research on the significance of IMMT in cancers\nis rare, and the only literature proposed that IMMT expression might be\nrelated to cancer prognosis13,14. To date, few reports have been published on\nthe relationship between IMMT and the development and progression of BC, and\nthe functions of IMMT in BC remains largely undefined.\n\nThe purpose of this investigation was to delve into the potential functions\nand underlying biological processes of IMMT in the development and progression\nof BC. To achieve this objective, bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry\n(IHC) were utilized to determine the prognostic significance of IMMT and its\ncorrelation with clinicopathological parameters in BC patients.

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4.

These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors.

These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression.

This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237].

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021).

Higher BMI during childhood is also linked to an increased likelihood of early menarche.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

{"question_new": "What is the purpose of the fluorescent probe developed by Gao et al.?", "answer_new": "The purpose of the fluorescent probe is to visualize changes in both tumor-associated protease activity and pH.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021). Alternol was isolated from the fermentation of a mutant fungus obtained from Taxus brevifolia bark (Liu et al., 2020).

It also decreases the percentages of KLRG1+ and PD-1+ cells in these cell populations.", "context": "CAFs are induced by cancer cells through TGF-\u03b2, and they create a mechanical\nbarrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth. Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023).

These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239].

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023).

These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors.

Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

{"question_new": "How do TP53 mutations affect cancer treatment?", "answer_new": "TP53 mutations are linked to resistance to various cancer treatments and a poorer prognosis.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021). Alternol was isolated from the fermentation of a mutant fungus obtained from Taxus brevifolia bark (Liu et al., 2020).

Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023).

These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020).

Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.

However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021). Alternol was isolated from the fermentation of a mutant fungus obtained from Taxus brevifolia bark (Liu et al., 2020).

{"question_new": "What is the primary objective of creating a non-invasive AI-based decision-making system for breast cancer?", "answer_new": "The main goal is to predict essential molecular biomarkers in breast cancer tissue using routine imaging modalities, thereby avoiding invasive procedures.", "context": "Introduction ER is a crucial organelle with a lot of functions, including storage and buffering of calcium ions (Ca2+), lipid biosynthesis, and folding and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins (Celik et al., 2023). However, due to physical and chemical factors, cell homeostasis is easy to be destroyed and cellular proteins cannot be properly folded, causing a series of physiological responses, including lack of Ca2+ deficiency, molecular chaperone or cellular energy, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein variation and disulfide bond reduction (Oakes and Papa, 2015; Rufo et al., 2017). For maintaining ER homeostasis, cells have developed an adaptation mechanism through a series of adaptive pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz et al., 2020). The UPR aims to recover the ER-related protein folding ability by increasing the expression of ER-related chaperones and attenuating global protein translation (Rufo et al., 2017). In mammalian cells, the UPR is controlled by three ER stress sensors, namely, IRE1\u03b1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In homeostasis conditions, these proteins are kept in an inactive state by the master regulator of the UPR, the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78, also known as BiP) (Ernst et al., 2024). PERK protein responds to ER stress by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased expression of ATF4 protein and CHOP (Saaoud et al., 2024). IRE1\u03b1 protein cleaves the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) mRNA to generate a spliced XBP1 variant (XBP1s), which triggers ER stress by up-regulating a large number of genes involved in the UPR (Park et al., 2021). During ER stress, the ATF6 protein is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage by S1P and S2P. The cleaved N-terminal region of ATF6 protein is an active transcription factor for ER chaperones and XBP1 (de la Calle et al., 2022). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a subtype of cell death that triggers an adaptive immune response against remaining tumor cells (Aria and Rezaei, 2023; Sprooten et al., 2023). Certain chemo-drugs, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy were reported to induce ICD on treated tumor cells by eliciting ER stress and subsequent secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin membrane translocation, ATP and HMGB1 release, type-I interferon production, etc. (Galluzzi et al., 2020). These DAMPs then recruit innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to stimulate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eliminate remaining tumors. We recently demonstrated that the chemo-drug Mitoxantrone was a bona-fade ICD inducer for prostate cancer by activating eIF2\u03b1 via PERK/GCN2-dependent ER stress cascade (Li et al., 2020). We also discovered that Alternol, a novel small chemical compound, induced a strong ICD response in prostate cancer via releasing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines while the molecular mechanism was not determined (Li et al., 2021). Alternol was isolated from the fermentation of a mutant fungus obtained from Taxus brevifolia bark (Liu et al., 2020).

The mortality of BC\npatients has been significantly reduced by radical surgery, radiotherapy,\nchemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy within the past decade,\nbut many patients still experience recurrence or metastasis, eventually\nleading to death2. The utilization of molecular typing, specifically with\nregards to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and other markers, has\nsignificantly enhanced the precision of treatment for BC. However, the\nbiological diversity of this disease presents a formidable obstacle in the\ndevelopment of personalized therapies3.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming is regarded as a hallmark of malignant neoplasms, and\na large number of investigations have demonstrated that the metabolic traits\nand predilections of tumors undergo alterations throughout the course of\ncancer development4. At the early stage, tumor growth requires a large amount\nof nutrient absorption and biosynthesis, and additional subtype-selective\nmetabolic requirements arise during infiltration, which rely on new pathways\nfor growth and metastasis5. Mitochondria are the key organelles involved in\nmetabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, and maintaining mitochondrial\nintegrity is the absolute basis of oxidative phosphorylation6. In addition,\nprevious studies have also indicated that the number, structure, and function\nof mitochondria often change in malignant tumor cells to meet the needs of\nrapid growth in acidic and anoxic environments7.\n\nAs a key regulatory subunit of mitochondrial integrity, mitochondrial inner\nmembrane protein (IMMT), also known as Mic-60 or Mitofilin8, is not only an\nimportant part of the mitochondrial contact sites and cristae organization\nsystem (MICOS) complex, but it also interacts with members of the SAM (The\nSorting and Assembly Machinery) complex to form the mitochondrial membrane\nspace bridging complex9. Recent studies have linked IMMT to the onset of\nvarious diseases, including cardiomyopathy10, degenerative encephalopathy11\nand kidney injury12. However, research on the significance of IMMT in cancers\nis rare, and the only literature proposed that IMMT expression might be\nrelated to cancer prognosis13,14. To date, few reports have been published on\nthe relationship between IMMT and the development and progression of BC, and\nthe functions of IMMT in BC remains largely undefined.\n\nThe purpose of this investigation was to delve into the potential functions\nand underlying biological processes of IMMT in the development and progression\nof BC. To achieve this objective, bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry\n(IHC) were utilized to determine the prognostic significance of IMMT and its\ncorrelation with clinicopathological parameters in BC patients. Furthermore,\nin vitro experiments were conducted to assess the impact of IMMT on the\nproliferation and apoptosis of BC cells, and the morphological and functional\nchanges of mitochondria after IMMT knockdown (KD) were also evaluated.\nAdditionally, functional enrichment analysis and\n\n", "question": "What is the potential function of IMMT in the development and progression of BC?", "answer": "IMMT may play a role in the development and progression of BC by regulating mitochondrial integrity and metabolic reprogramming.", "prompt": "You can paraphrase the question and answer."}
{"question_new": "In which tissues is ER\u03b1 primarily found?", "answer_new": "ER\u03b1 is predominantly located in tissues known to be influenced by estrogen, including the uterus, breast, placenta, liver, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and bone tissue.", "context": "CAFs are induced by cancer cells through TGF-\u03b2, and they create a mechanical\nbarrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth. Inflammatory CAFs,\nlocated away from the tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to generate\ncytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which further stimulate cancer growth.\nLastly, antigen-presenting CAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate\nthe immune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions contribute to the\ncomplex dynamics of the PDAC stroma [12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs\nplay a significant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by releasing\nsubstances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8\n[35, 229\u2013231]. Not only do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer activities of CD8+ T\ncells by increasing the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints [230].\nRecently, a study identified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts\n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-metastatic myofibroblastic-MAFs\n(myMAFs) being critically dependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced\nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn promote an immunosuppressive\nmacrophage phenotype, inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3\npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores an anti-tumor immune\nresponse and reduces metastasis, providing potential targets to inhibit PDAC\nliver metastasis [232].\n\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\n\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of PSCs, which are located in\nboth the exocrine and endocrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The\ninteraction between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes tumor\nprogression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several growth factors/mediators\n(such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor\n[bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-derived factor 1\n[SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, which provoke the proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic\ncancer cells produce TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn stimulate PSCs to\nincrease the migration and proliferation of CAFs and the production of ECM\n[233, 234]. Indeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic reaction,\nseen in both primary and metastatic tumors. This reaction is caused by the\nactivation of PSCs, by cancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor\n[235, 236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms a mechanical\nbarrier around the tumor cells, hindering proper vascularization, limiting the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltration\n[237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 and they hasten the\nadvancement of the tumor in a murine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-\u03b21\nsecreted by PSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancreatic cancer\ncells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. Overall, PSCs are linked to ECM\nproduction and remodeling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to\nchemotherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced apoptosis,\nangiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain factors [234].\n\nEndothelial cells\n\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, leading to a hostile\nmicroenvironment\n\n", "question": "What role do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play in the pancreatic environment?", "answer": "CAFs create a mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit tumor growth.
